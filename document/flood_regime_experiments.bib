	abstract = {As hydraulic, hydrologic, and biogeochemical models evolve toward greater spatial resolution and larger extent, robust morphometric data sets are essential to constrain their results. Here we present the Landsat-derived North American River Width (NARWidth) data set, the first fine-resolution, continental scale river centerline and width database. NARWidth contains measurements of {\textgreater}2.4 × 105 km of rivers wider than 30 m at mean annual discharge. We find that conventional digital elevation model-derived width data sets underestimate the abundance of wide rivers. To calculate the total surface area of North American rivers, we extrapolate the strong observed relationship between river width and total surface area at different river widths (r2 {\textgreater} 0.99 for 100–2000 m widths) to narrower rivers and streams. We conservatively estimate the total surface area of North American rivers as 1.24−0.15+0.39 × 105 km2 (1σ confidence intervals), values 20−15+38\% greater than previous estimates used to evaluate greenhouse gas efflux from rivers to the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The Wasatch and Green River Formations in the Uinta Basin contain fluvial sandstones that record terrestrial sedimentation coincident with Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) and six post-PETM hyperthermal climate change events. The Uinta Basin was one of a series of lacustrine basins isolated by Laramide uplifts in the Rocky Mountain region during the Early Eocene, and this project will better constrain the relative influence of both tectonic and climatic forcing on fluvial systems that fed sediment and water to these endorheic basins. This dataset combines quantitative petrographic analysis with carbon isotope analysis taken along measured stratigraphic sections in the southern margin of the Uinta Basin. This work shows that peak negative isotope excursions, related to pulses of greenhouse climate, correlate to regional flushing of sediment from catchment areas and progradation of fluvial systems into the lacustrine basin. This correlates to deeper channel incision, lateral and vertical amalgamation of channels, and delivery of relatively compositionally and texturally immature sediment to the basin. Understanding the compositional and textural maturity of these fluvial sandstones will provide insights into the response of chemical weathering rates, physical erosion rates, and the seasonality of sediment and water discharge to a series of global warming events. Climate change during the PETM was initiated by a release of over 2,000 gigatonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere, comparable in magnitude to that which could occur in the coming centuries from anthropogenic sources, and understanding the terrestrial response to extreme climatic forcing is important for predictive climate change modeling. Further, if terrestrial records of chemical weathering rates differ substantially from proxies developed from marine sediments, carbon-cycle dynamics during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum must be reconsidered.},

Understanding transmission of environmental signals is crucial for predicting landscape response to climate change, and interpreting paleo-climate and tectonics from stratigraphy. Here we propose that sediment transport can act as a nonlinear filter that completely destroys (“shreds”) environmental signals. This results from ubiquitous thresholds in sediment transport systems; e.g., landsliding, bed load transport, and river avulsion. This “morphodynamic turbulence” is analogous to turbulence in fluid flows, where energy injected at one frequency is smeared across a range of scales. We show with a numerical model that external signals are shredded when their time and amplitude scales fall within the ranges of morphodynamic turbulence. As signal frequency increases, signal preservation becomes the exception rather than the rule, suggesting a critical re-examination of purported sedimentary signals of external forcing.},

	abstract = {Mountain rivers play a key role in the delivery of particulate organic carbon (POC) to large river systems and the ocean. Due to the extent of its drainage area and runoff, the Amazon River is one of Earth's most important biogeochemical systems. However, the source of POC eroded from the humid region of the Eastern Andes and the input of fossil POC from sedimentary rocks (POCfossil) remains poorly constrained. Here we collected suspended sediments from the Kosñipata River during flood events to better characterize Andean POC, measuring the nitrogen to organic carbon ratio (N/C), stable carbon isotopes (δ13Corg) and radiocarbon (Δ14Corg). Δ14Corg values ranged from −711‰ to −15‰, and significant linear trends between Δ14Corg, N/C and δ13Corg suggested that this reflects the mixing of POCfossil with very young organic matter (Δ14Corg {\textasciitilde} 50‰) from the terrestrial biosphere (POCnon-fossil). Using N/C and Δ14Corg in an end-member mixing analysis, we quantify the fraction of POCfossil (to within 0.1) and find that it contributes a constant proportion of the suspended sediment mass (0.37 ± 0.03\%) and up to 80\% of total POC. In contrast, the relative contribution of POCnon-fossil was variable, being most important during the rising limb and peak discharges of flood events. The new data shed light on published measurements of “old” POC (low Δ14Corg) in Andean-fed tributaries of the Amazon River, with their Δ14Corg and δ13Corg values consistent with variable addition of POCfossil. The findings suggest a greater persistence of Andean POC in the lowland Amazon than previously recognized.},

	abstract = {We investigated the processes of sediment exchange between the Strickland River and its lowland floodplain, documenting (1) the rates, textures, and distributions of sediment accumulation, (2) temporal variations in these rates, (3) the remobilization of sediment by erosive processes, and (4) whether net storage is significant over century timescales. We used 210Pb geochronology of floodplain cores from 11 transects to measure deposition rates over the past ∼65 years, finding a decline from 5.5 cm/a (0–10 m distance from the channel) to 0.9 cm/a (∼400 m) to ∼0.1 cm/a ({\textgreater}1 km). Rates are elevated along curved sections of channel and are stable over time, and episodic accumulation is prevalent and may be correlated to floods. Integrated temporally and spatially, the average rate is 1.6 cm/a. Integrating along both sides of ∼318 river km we studied for the lowland Strickland, we calculate 12–19 Mt of annual sediment accumulation (∼0.05 Mt/km or 0.07\% of the annual load per km of river length), representing 17–27\% of the total annual sediment flux. We used georeferenced Landsat images (1972–2001) to quantify channel migration and the resulting return of sediment to the channel. Mean lateral migration was 5.1 ± 0.8 m/a. Given the floodplain width of ∼10 km, this implies a waiting time of ∼1 ka between floodplain formation and subsequent reentrainment of the bank as the channel migrates laterally. This raises the possibility that the net return of material from the floodplain due to channel migration could balance the overbank deposition we observed. The exchange flux between cut bank erosion and point bar deposition is 20–40 Mt, highlighting the significance of sediment recycling (∼50\% of the total load). Such sediment trapping and recycling affects the transport, storage, and evolution of biogeochemically reactive particles, the evolution of the floodplain, and the morphodynamics of basin infilling.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the concept of global monsoon. We demonstrate that the primary climatological features of the tropical precipitation and low-level circulation can be represented by a three-parameter metrics: the annual mean and two major modes of annual variation, namely, a solstitial mode and an equinoctial asymmetric mode. Together, the two major modes of annual cycle account for 84\% of the annual variance and they represent the global monsoon. The global monsoon precipitation domain can be delineated by a simple monsoon precipitation index (MPI), which is the local annual range of precipitation (MJJAS minus NDJFM in the Northern Hemisphere and NDJFM minus MJJAS in the Southern Hemisphere) normalized by the annual mean precipitation. The monsoon domain can be defined by annual range exceeding 300mm and the MPI exceeding 50\%. The three-parameter precipitation climatology metrics and global monsoon domain proposed in the present paper provides a valuable objective tool for gauging the climate models’ performance on simulation and prediction of the mean climate and annual cycle. The metrics are used to evaluate the precipitation climatology in three global reanalysis products (ERA40, NCEP2, and JRA25) in terms of their pattern correlation coefficients and root mean square errors with reference to observations. The ensemble mean of the three analysis datasets is considerably superior to any of the individual reanalysis data in representing annual mean, annual cycle, and the global monsoon domain. A major common deficiency is found over the Southeast Asia-Philippine Sea and southeast North America-Caribbean Sea where the east–west land–ocean thermal contrast and meridional hemispheric thermal contrast coexist. It is speculated that the weakness is caused by models’ unrealistic representation of Subtropical High and under-represented tropical storm activity, as well as by neglecting atmosphere–ocean interaction in the reanalysis. It is recommended that ensemble mean of reanalysis datasets be used for improving global precipitation climatology and water cycle budget. This paper also explains why the latitudinal asymmetry in the tropical circulation decreases with altitude.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial paleoclimate records rely on proxies hosted in alluvial strata whose beds are deposited by unsteady and nonlinear geomorphic processes. It is broadly assumed that this renders the resultant time series of terrestrial paleoclimatic variability noisy and incomplete. We evaluate this assumption using a model of oscillating climate and the precise topographic evolution of an experimental alluvial system. We find that geomorphic stochasticity can create aliasing in the time series and spurious climate signals, but these issues are eliminated when the period of climate oscillation is longer than a key time scale of internal dynamics in the geomorphic system. This emergent autogenic geomorphic behavior imparts regularity to deposition and represents a natural discretization interval of the continuous climate signal. We propose that this time scale in nature could be in excess of 104 years but would still allow assessments of the rates of climate change at resolutions finer than the existing age model techniques in isolation.
Mesoscale geomorphic processes impose regularity in deposition, allowing quantitative resolution of proxy-based climate reconstructions.

	abstract = {The quantitative model presented simulates the development of a two-dimensional alluvial sedimentary succession beneath a floodplain traversed by a single major river. Several inter-related effects which influence the distribution of channel-belt sand and gravel bodies within overbank fines are accounted for. These are (a) laterally variable aggradation, (b) compaction of fine sediment, (c) tectonic movement at floodplain margins, and (d) channel avulsion. Selected experiments with the model show how the interconnectedness and areal density of channel-belt deposits decrease with increasing floodplain width/channel-belt size, mean avulsion period, and channel-belt aggradation rate. Separation of stream patterns based on interconnectedness and channel deposit density is difficult. Tectonic movements do not have a significant influence upon the successions unless a preferred direction of tilting is maintained (half-graben). Then channel-belt deposits showing offlap tendencies tend to cluster adjacent to the active floodplain margin, leaving dominantly fine-grained alluvium to accumulate on the inactive side. Individual channel-belt deposits thicken during aggradation, although a self-regulating limit to such thickening is likely to operate. ‘Multistorey’features resulting from aggradation may be difficult to tell apart from those arising through superposition of distinct channel-belt deposits of avulsive origin.},

	abstract = {Various, but related, models have been proposed to explain the architectural arrangement of channel stacking patterns in avulsion-dominated alluvial sequences. The early models published by Leeder, Allen, and Bridge (LAB) addressed the role of changes in sedimentation rate (a proxy for subsidence rate) as a control on stacking patterns. The models decouple avulsion frequency from sedimentation rates, resulting in an inverse relationship between stacking density (or interconnectedness) and sedimentation rates. A key element missing from these models is the likely dependence of avulsion frequency on local sedimentation rate within the active channel belt. We consider a simple model whereby avulsion takes place only when a minimum, critical, relief is developed between a channel bank and the adjacent flood plain. If avulsion frequency increases at rates slower than the increase in sedimentation rate, then stacking density increases with decreasing sedimentation rate, similar to that predicted by the LAB models. However, if avulsion frequency increases linearly with sedimentation rate, then there is no change in stacking pattern with changes in sedimentation rate. If avulsion frequency increases faster than sedimentation rates, as seen in some data sets, then stacking patterns become more dense with increasing sedimentation rates, a result that is the exact opposite of that predicted by the LAB models. Therefore sensitive dependence on the relationship between avulsion frequency and sedimentation rate calls into question the veracity of some previous interpretations of relative subsidence made in alluvial architecture studies. We provide an alternative, simple geometric model that links changes in subsidence rate to downstream rate of change in stacking pattern as seen in three dimensions within sedimentary basins. Other controls that are considered include: the geometry of subsidence; whether avulsions take place locally along a river or regionally affect the basin; whether local sedimentation rate or flow depth controls the thickness of sand bodies; and the exact relationship between avulsion frequency and sedimentation rate. The primary result of the model is that subsidence strongly influences the rate at which alluvial architecture changes in the downstream direction, but other controls dictate whether the stacking pattern becomes more dense or less dense downstream. Hence, we suggest that subsidence exerts an influence on stacking patterns not necessarily evident in individual vertical sections, but may be recorded in three dimensions as downstream changes in alluvial architecture. Unfortunately any model of alluvial architecture in avulsion-dominated sequences is limited by our lack of understanding of the processes controlling avulsion. As a result any model of alluvial stacking patterns is at best a working hypothesis that should not be taken as proof of changes in tectonic subsidence rates or sea-level changes.},

	abstract = {Interest in pre-Quaternary paleosols has increased over the past decade, in large part, because they have proved to be beneficial in solving diverse geological problems. The majority of paleosols are described from continental deposits, most commonly from alluvial strata. Criteria for recognizing these paleosols have been extensively described; however, classifying them has proved more complicated. Pre-Quaternary paleosols are generally classified according to one or more modern soil classification systems, although one new classification has been proposed exclusively for paleosols to avoid problems using the modern soil classifications. In addition to taxonomic classification, paleosols can be categorized according to the interplay among deposition, erosion, and the rate of pedogenesis when they formed. Paleosols can be solitary if they formed during a period of landscape stability following the development of an unconformity. Such paleosols are commonly thick and extremely well developed. More commonly, paleosols are vertically stacked or multistory because they formed in sedimentary systems undergoing net aggradation. If erosion was insignificant and sedimentation was rapid and unsteady, compound paleosols generally formed. If the rate of pedogenesis exceeded the rate of deposition, composite paleosols developed. Thick, cumulative paleosols indicate that erosion was insignificant and that sedimentation was relatively steady. Both autogenic and allogenic processes can influence depositional and erosion patterns and, thus, affect the kinds of soils that form. Consequently, paleosols can help to interpret the history of sediment deposition and the autogenic and allogenic processes that influenced a sedimentary basin. Paleosols are also helpful in stratigraphic studies, including sequence stratigraphic analyses. They are used for stratigraphic correlations at the local and basinal scale, and some workers have calculated sediment accumulation rates based on the degree of paleosol development. In addition to their stratigraphic applications, paleosols can be used to interpret landscapes of the past by analyzing paleosol–landscape associations at different spatial scales, ranging from local to basin-wide in scope. At the local scale, lateral changes in paleosol properties are largely the result of variations in grain size and topography. At the scale of the sedimentary basin, paleosols in different locations differ because of basinal variations in topography, grain size, climate, and subsidence rate. Paleosols are used to reconstruct ancient climates, even to estimate ancient mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT). Ancient climatic conditions can be interpreted from modern soil analogs or by identifying particular pedogenic properties that modern studies show to have climatic significance. Stable carbon and oxygen isotopes are also used to interpret ancient climate, and some effort has been made to estimate MAT from isotopic composition. On the basis of modern soil analogs, paleo-precipitation has been estimated from the depth at which calcic horizons originally formed. Finally, paleosol carbonates have been used to estimate ancient atmospheric CO2 values.},

Although the CIE is the major criterion for global correlation of the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, spatial variations in the position and shape of the CIE have not been systematically evaluated. We measured carbon isotope ratios of bulk organic matter (δ13Corg) and pedogenic carbonate (δ13Ccarb) at six PETM sections across a 16 km transect in the SE Bighorn Basin, Wyoming. Bed tracing and high-resolution floral and faunal biostratigraphy allowed correlation of the sections independent of chemostratigraphy. The onset of the CIE in bulk organic matter at all six sections occurs within a single laterally extensive geosol. The magnitude of the CIE varies from 2.1 to 3.8‰. The absolute and relative stratigraphic thickness of the body of the CIE in bulk organic matter varies significantly across the field area and underrepresents the thickness of the PETM body by 30\%–80\%. The variations cannot be explained by basinal position and instead suggest that δ13Corg values were influenced by local factors such as reworking of older carbon. The stratigraphic thickness and shape of the CIE have been used to correlate sections, estimate timing of biotic and climatic changes relative to the presumed carbon isotope composition of the atmosphere, and calculate rates of environmental and biotic change. Localized controls on δ13Corg values place these inferences in question by influencing the apparent shape and duration of the CIE.},

The complexity and stratigraphic spacing of paleosols change through the study section. Comparison to the climate record, reconstructed from paleosols, indicates the changes correspond to Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum climatic fluctuations. In particular, the middle of the section contains thick, welded paleosols and thin avulsion deposits that link to times of well-drained floodplains and lower mean annual precipitation. Stratigraphic intervals below and above the main part of the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum interval correspond to times of less well drained floodplains and higher mean annual precipitation. These strata contain thinner paleosols and thick avulsion deposits. Differences in paleosol complexity and spacing suggest that sediment flux to the depositional site varied in response to precipitation fluctuations associated with the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. Welded paleosols and thin avulsion deposits indicate reduced floodplain accretion during deposition of the middle of the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. Intervals with widely spaced paleosols indicate more rapid accretion. We hypothesize that drier episodes associated with warming caused reduced vegetation in source areas and promoted erosion and increased sediment yield. Because precipitation was reduced, much of that sediment was stored in upstream reaches of the fluvial system rather than moving to the depositional basin. Welded paleosols formed because of diminished sediment supply to the basin. With a return to wetter conditions during the recovery phase of the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, upstream water flux increased, stored sediment moved to the basin, and vertically spaced, thinner paleosols developed. The results demonstrate how vertical sections of alluvial paleosols can provide information on how climate fluctuated through time and how the fluvial system responded to climate change.},

	abstract = {The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) is the most rapid climatic warming event in the Cenozoic and informs us how the Earth system responds to large-scale changes to the carbon cycle. Warming was triggered by a massive release of 13C depleted carbon to the atmosphere, evidenced by negative carbon isotope excursions (CIE) in nearly every carbon pool on Earth. Differences in these CIEs can give insight into the response of different ecosystems to perturbations in the carbon cycle. Here we present records of δ13Ccc of pedogenic carbonates and δ13Corg from preserved soil organic matter in corresponding paleosols to understand changes to soil carbon during the PETM. CIEs during the event are larger in pedogenic carbonates than preserved organic matter for corresponding paleosols at three sites across two continents. The difference in the CIEs within soil carbon pools can be explained by increased respiration and carbon turnover rates of near-surface labile soil carbon. Increased rates of labile carbon cycling combined with decreases in the amount of preserved organic carbon in soils during the PETM suggests a decrease in the size of the soil carbon pool, resulting in a potential increase in atmospheric pCO2 and a positive feedback with warming. The PETM is a model for how the earth system responds to warming, and this mechanism would suggest that soils might serve as a large source for atmospheric CO2 during warming events.},

	abstract = {Many models of river meander migration rely upon a simple formalism, whereby the eroding bank is cut back at a rate that is dictated by the flow, and the depositing bank then migrates passively in response, so as to maintain a constant bankfull channel width. Here a new model is presented, in which separate relations are developed for the migration of the eroding bank and the depositing bank. It is assumed that the eroding bank consists of a layer of fine-grained sediment that is cohesive and/or densely riddled with roots, underlain by a purely noncohesive layer of sand and/or gravel. Following erosion of the noncohesive layer, the cohesive layer fails in the form of slump blocks, which armor the noncohesive layer and thereby moderate the erosion rate. If the slump block material breaks down or is fluvially entrained, the protection it provides for the noncohesive layer diminishes and bank erosion is renewed. Renewed bank erosion, however, rejuvenates slump block armoring. At the depositing bank, it is assumed that all the sediment delivered to the edge of vegetation due to the transverse component of sediment transport is captured by encroaching vegetation, which is not removed by successive floods. Separate equations describing the migration of the eroding and depositing banks are tied to a standard morphodynamic formulation for the evolution of the flow and bed in the central region of the channel. In this model, the river evolves toward maintenance of roughly constant bankfull width as it migrates only to the extent that the eroding bank and depositing bank ‘talk’ to each other via the medium of the morphodynamics of the channel center region. The model allows for both (a) migration for which erosion widens the channel, forcing deposition at the opposite bank, and (b) migration for which deposition narrows the channel forcing erosion at the opposite bank.

	abstract = {New methods of data collection and processing are developed to provide quantitative, reach-scale measurements of bedform transport mass within the tidally influenced Mississippi River. A multibeam swath profiler was used to collect daily bathymetry over a range of water discharges, and bed elevation changes induced by dune migration are measured. These values are coupled with bulk physical properties of the bed sediment to constrain mass flux, and annual bedform transport is estimated at 2.2 × 106 metric tons (MT). The total annual sand flux from the Mississippi River, calculated by combining measured bedform transport rates and suspended sediment flux, is estimated to be 20 × 106 MT. Survey data also provide information about the spatial distribution of dunes across the channel bottom. Straight reach segments are commonly mantled by dunes for the entire cross section, while bends are typically areas of focused scour devoid of bedforms. Presumably, any sediments associated with migrating dunes are propelled into suspension within bends before redepositing in the subsequent straight reach. Movement via suspension is therefore an important component for the downriver transport of bed materials in the lower Mississippi River.},

	abstract = {The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) hyperthermal, {\textasciitilde}56millionyears ago (Ma), is the most dramatic example of abrupt Cenozoic global warming. During the PETM surface temperatures increased between 5 and 9°C and the onset likely took {\textless}20kyr. The PETM provides a case study of the impacts of rapid global warming on the Earth system, including both hydrological and associated biogeochemical feedbacks, and proxy data from the PETM can provide constraints on changes in warm climate hydrology simulated by general circulation models (GCMs). In this paper, we provide a critical review of biological and geochemical signatures interpreted as direct or indirect indicators of hydrological change at the PETM, explore the importance of adopting multi-proxy approaches, and present a preliminary model-data comparison. Hydrological records complement those of temperature and indicate that the climatic response at the PETM was complex, with significant regional and temporal variability. This is further illustrated by the biogeochemical consequences of inferred changes in hydrology and, in fact, changes in precipitation and the biogeochemical consequences are often conflated in geochemical signatures. There is also strong evidence in many regions for changes in the episodic and/or intra-annual distribution of precipitation that has not widely been considered when comparing proxy data to GCM output. Crucially, GCM simulations indicate that the response of the hydrological cycle to the PETM was heterogeneous – some regions are associated with increased precipitation – evaporation (P – E), whilst others are characterised by a decrease. Interestingly, the majority of proxy data come from the regions where GCMs predict an increase in PETM precipitation. We propose that comparison of hydrological proxies to GCM output can be an important test of model skill, but this will be enhanced by further data from regions of model-simulated aridity and simulation of extreme precipitation events.},

The physical characteristics of the sediment record are controlled by three main factors: the sediment supply from the eroding source region, the grain size distribution of that sediment supply, and the area available for sediment accumulation in the downstream regions3,4. The interplay of these factors can make the interpretation of a climatic or tectonic signal complex, particularly as these processes are nonlinear. Here we assess the evolution of a tectonically active landscape undergoing erosional and depositional processes, using a numerical model that incorporates variations in grain size and the volumetric sediment budget. Our simulations indicate that changes in precipitation and tectonic uplift both generate characteristic patterns of grain size and stratigraphic geometry. An increase in catchment precipitation results in the deposition of a laterally extensive sheet of coarse gravel. The responses to a changing tectonic regime are more diverse: a large increase in uplift rate results first in the deposition of sediments of larger grain size at proximal sites, followed by a reduction in grain size at distal locations. We conclude that the stratigraphic record is strongly controlled by the grain size of sediments released from catchments undergoing tectonic or climatic change.},

	abstract = {Recent investigations have shown that the extent of the channel network in some drainage basins is controlled by a threshold for overland flow erosion. The sensitivity of such basins to climate change is analyzed using a physically based model of drainage basin evolution. The GOLEM model simulates basin evolution under the action of weathering processes, hillslope transport, and fluvial bedrock erosion and sediment transport. Results from perturbation analyses reveal that the nature and timescale of basin response depends on the direction of change. An increase in runoff intensity (or a decrease in vegetation cover) will lead to a rapid expansion of the channel network, with the resulting increase in sediment supply initially generating aggradation along the main network, followed by downcutting as the sediment supply tapers off. By contrast, a decrease in runoff intensity (or an increase in the erosion threshold) will lead to a retraction of the active channel network and a much more gradual geomorphic response. Cyclic changes in runoff intensity are shown to produce aggradational-degradational cycles that resemble those observed in the field. Cyclic variations in runoff also lead to highly punctuated denudation rates, with denudation concentrated during periods of increasing runoff intensity and/or decreasing vegetation cover. The sediment yield from threshold-dominated basins may therefore exhibit significant variability in response to relatively subtle environmental changes, a finding which underscores the need for caution in interpreting modern sediment-yield data.},

	abstract = {Understanding how landscapes respond to climate dynamics in terms of macroscale (average topographic features) and microscale (landform reorganization) is of interest both for deciphering past climates from today's landscapes and for predicting future landscapes in view of recent climatic trends. Although several studies have addressed macro-scale response, only a few have focused on quantifying smaller-scale basin reorganization. To that goal, a series of controlled laboratory experiments were conducted where a self-organized complete drainage network emerged under constant precipitation and uplift dynamics. Once steady state was achieved, the landscape was subjected to a fivefold increase in precipitation (transient state). Throughout the evolution, high-resolution spatiotemporal topographic data in the form of digital elevation models were collected. The steady state landscape was shown to possess three distinct geomorphic regimes (unchannelized hillslopes, debris-dominated channels, and fluvially dominated channels). During transient state, landscape reorganization was observed to be driven by hillslopes via accelerated erosion, ridge lowering, channel widening, and reduction of basin relief as opposed to channel base-level reduction. Quantitative metrics on which these conclusions were based included slope-area curve, correlation analysis of spatial and temporal elevation increments, and wavelet spectral analysis of the evolving landscapes. Our results highlight that landscape reorganization in response to increased precipitation seems to follow “an arrow of scale”: major elevation change initiates at the hillslope scale driving erosional regime change at intermediate scales and further cascading to geomorphic changes at the channel scale as time evolves.},

	abstract = {Alluvial river channels are self-formed by the sediment-laden flow that is supplied to them from upstream and the interactions between this flow and the materials forming the channel bed and banks. Thus, any changes in the volumes of solid and liquid discharge or the resistance of the boundary materials can produce adjustments in the form of river channels over time. These shifts may increase or decrease the capacity of a channel to contain flood flows. However, despite a wealth of studies on the average geometry of river channels across different scales and climatic regimes, there has not yet been a systematic assessment of the rates and controls of trends in channel form. Using a combination of USGS data, including manual field measurements and mean daily streamflow data at hundreds of stream gages, this work is the first attempt to quantify how trends in channel geometry develop over decadal timescales and how they contribute to shifts in flood hazard, in comparison with trends in streamflow. Findings reveal that two-thirds of all channel cross-sections studied exhibit significant trends in channel geometry. The majority of the investigated US river channels are eroding, with widening and deepening trends partially offset by decreases in average flow velocity. Rates of change are principally controlled by the channel size. Although large channels develop larger trends, changes are proportionally greater in small channels in percentage terms. A secondary major control is hydrology: rates of change in channel geometry are heightened by the variability and flashiness of flow regimes. Finally, results show that changing flood frequencies can only be accurately quantified when both hydrologic and geomorphic trends are accounted for, and that flood hazard is significantly increasing across the studied sites. These documented trends in channel geometry, hydraulics, and flood hazard have important implications for the management of alluvial channels, navigation, and riverside infrastructure.},

An analysis of an equation for total sediment flux in the limits of suspension‐, bedload‐, and mixed‐modes of transport indicates distinct, steady‐state regimes of channel morphology. Such regimes are readily seen in published data for modern alluvial rivers by way of a conventional Shields plot or a plot of channel slope as a function of relative grain size d/h and the ratio ws/u, where d and ws are, respectively, mean diameter and fall speed of bed sediments, and h and u, are, respectively, mean depth and friction velocity of the flow. With slope and mode of transport in an alluvial river constrained by grain size and channel depth alone, estimates of discharge and sediment flux follow directly. Introduction of the sediment flux relationship into conventional diffusion models for the evolution of an alluvial system provides nominal estimates of the response time for channel adjustment to some external changes. For some major modern rivers, this time of response along the entire length of channel is in the range 103–105 yr, underscoring the potential for complicated, long‐time interaction of large alluvial systems with, for example, climatic variability.},

To achieve this, we develop a two-dimensional optimal channel network (OCN) model with a controllable rainfall distribution to simulate the evolution of river networks, governed by the principle of minimum energy expenditure, inside a prescribed boundary. We show that under nonuniform precipitation conditions, river networks reorganize significantly toward new patterns with different geomorphic and hydrologic signatures. This reorganization is mainly observed in the form of migration of channels of different orders, widening or elongation of basins as well as formation and extinction of channels and basins. In particular, when the precipitation gradient is locally increased, the higher-order channels, including the mainstream river, migrate toward regions with higher precipitation intensity. Through pertinent examples, the reorganization of the drainage network is quantified via stream parameters such as Horton-Strahler and Tokunaga measures, order-based channel total length and river long profiles obtained via simulation of three-dimensional basin topography, while the hydrologic response of the evolved network is investigated using metrics such as hydrograph and power spectral density of simulated streamflows at the outlet of the network. In addition, using OCNs, we investigate the effect of orographic precipitation patterns on multicatchment landscapes composed of several interacting basins. Our results show that network-inspired methods can be utilized as insightful and versatile models for directly exploring the effects of climate change on the evolution of river drainage systems.},

	abstract = {Filtering out the effect of large floods
Large floods should seemingly influence the depth and width of rivers. Phillips and Jerolmack, however, suggest that the self-organization of bedrock river channels blunts the impact of extreme rainfall events. River channel geometries from a wide range of course-grained rivers across the United States show that larger floods have very limited additional impact on channel geometry. River channel sculpting does increase as flood size increases, but the effect is most pronounced for moderate floods. This relationship may explain the long-term stability of rivers across shifts in climate.
Science, this issue p. 694
Spatial and temporal variations in rainfall are hypothesized to influence landscape evolution through erosion and sediment transport by rivers. However, determining the relation between rainfall and river dynamics requires a greater understanding of the feedbacks between flooding and a river’s capacity to transport sediment. We analyzed channel geometry and stream-flow records from 186 coarse-grained rivers across the United States. We found that channels adjust their shape so that floods slightly exceed the critical shear velocity needed to transport bed sediment, independently of climatic, tectonic, and bedrock controls. The distribution of fluid shear velocity associated with floods is universal, indicating that self-organization of near-critical channels filters the climate signal evident in discharge. This effect blunts the impact of extreme rainfall events on landscape evolution.
A wide-ranging assessment of rivers in the United States suggests that erosion and climate become decoupled during large rainfall events.

	abstract = {Detrital zircon grains (n=468) from eolian sandstones of Permian and Jurassic sand seas on the Colorado Plateau of southwest Laurentia fall into six separable age populations defined by discrete peaks on age–probability plots. The eolian sands include significant contributions from all Precambrian age belts of the Laurentian craton and all key plutonic assemblages of the Appalachian orogen marking the Laurentia–Gondwana suture within Pangaea. Nearly half the detrital zircon grains were derived ultimately from Grenvillian (1315–1000 Ma), Pan-African (750–500 Ma), and Paleozoic (500–310 Ma) bedrock sources lying within or along the flank of the Appalachian orogen. Recycled origins for Appalachian-derived grains, except for temporary residence of synorogenic detritus in the Appalachian foreland basin or in deformed Ouachita flysch and molasses along tectonic strike, are precluded by regional geology and known geochronology from other Laurentian sedimentary assemblages. We infer that transcontinental Permian and Jurassic river systems transported detritus of Appalachian provenance westward across the subdued surface of the Laurentian craton, for deposition as proximate sources for eolian systems feeding the ergs, on unconsolidated fluvial plains, deltas, and strandlines that lay up-paleowind along or near the Cordilleran paleoshoreline north and northeast of the Colorado Plateau. The postulated river systems headed in the remnant Appalachian orogen (Permian) or the incipient Atlantic rift belt (Jurassic), and additional transport of the Appalachian-derived detritus toward the Colorado Plateau was achieved by longshore drift of sediment southward along the Cordilleran paleoshoreline under the influence of prevailing trade winds in the Permian–Jurassic tropics. Only a quarter of the eolianite detrital zircons were derived or recycled from Mesoproterozoic (1470–1335 Ma) and younger Paleoproterozoic (1800–1615 Ma) basement of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains province adjacent to the Colorado Plateau. The final quarter of eolianite detrital zircons were derived from older Paleoproterozoic (2200–1800 Ma) and Archaean (3015–2580 Ma) basement of the Laurentian shield, or recycled from its sedimentary cover. Both Laurentian shield and Ancestral Rockies detritus may have entered the same transcontinental river systems (through tributary streams), or the same Cordilleran strandline system (by longshore drift), responsible for the delivery of Appalachian-derived sediment to positions near the Colorado Plateau ergs. As Colorado Plateau ergs received contributions from all the potential bedrock sources contiguous with Permian–Jurassic Laurentia and its orogenic–taphrogenic margins, detrital zircon studies of analogous ancient erg deposits elsewhere may help test reconstructions of Rodinia and other ancient paleocontinents by providing proxy records of the full age ranges of bedrock sources distributed across the surfaces of entire landmasses.},

The first and largest of these events, the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), is characterized by a massive input of carbon, ocean acidification2 and an increase in global temperature of about 5 °C within a few thousand years3. Although various explanations for the PETM have been proposed4,5,6, a satisfactory model that accounts for the source, magnitude and timing of carbon release at the PETM and successive hyperthermals remains elusive. Here we use a new astronomically calibrated cyclostratigraphic record from central Italy7 to show that the Early Eocene hyperthermals occurred during orbits with a combination of high eccentricity and high obliquity. Corresponding climate–ecosystem–soil simulations accounting for rising concentrations of background greenhouse gases8 and orbital forcing show that the magnitude and timing of the PETM and subsequent hyperthermals can be explained by the orbitally triggered decomposition of soil organic carbon in circum-Arctic and Antarctic terrestrial permafrost. This massive carbon reservoir had the potential to repeatedly release thousands of petagrams (1015 grams) of carbon to the atmosphere–ocean system, once a long-term warming threshold had been reached just before the PETM. Replenishment of permafrost soil carbon stocks following peak warming probably contributed to the rapid recovery from each event9, while providing a sensitive carbon reservoir for the next hyperthermal10. As background temperatures continued to rise following the PETM, the areal extent of permafrost steadily declined, resulting in an incrementally smaller available carbon pool and smaller hyperthermals at each successive orbital forcing maximum. A mechanism linking Earth’s orbital properties with release of soil carbon from permafrost provides a unifying model accounting for the salient features of the hyperthermals.},

In the late Paleocene to early Eocene, deep sea benthic foraminifera suffered their only global extinction of the last 75 million years and diversity decreased worldwide by 30–50\% in a few thousand years. At Maud Rise (Weddell Sea, Antarctica; Sites 689 and 690, palaeodepths 1100 m and 1900 m) and Walvis Ridge (Southeastern Atlantic, Sites 525 and 527, palaeodepths 1600 m and 3400 m) post-extinction faunas were low-diversity and high-dominance, but the dominant species differed by geographical location. At Maud Rise, post-extinction faunas were dominated by small, biserial and triserial species, while the large, thick-walled, long-lived deep sea species Nuttalides truempyi was absent. At Walvis Ridge, by contrast, they were dominated by long-lived species such as N. truempyi, with common to abundant small abyssaminid species. The faunal dominance patterns at the two locations thus suggest different post-extinction seafloor environments: increased flux of organic matter and possibly decreased oxygen levels at Maud Rise, decreased flux at Walvis Ridge. The species-richness remained very low for about 50 000 years, then gradually increased.
The extinction was synchronous with a large, negative, short-term excursion of carbon and oxygen isotopes in planktonic and benthic foraminifera and bulk carbonate. The isotope excursions reached peak negative values in a few thousand years and values returned to preexcursion levels in about 50 000 years. The carbon isotope excursion was about −2‰ for benthic foraminifera at Walvis Ridge and Maud Rise, and about −4‰ for planktonic foraminifera at Maud Rise. At the latter sites vertical gradients thus decreased, possibly at least partially as a result of upwelling. The oxygen isotope excursion was about −1.5‰ for benthic foraminifera at Walvis Ridge and Maud Rise, −1‰ for planktonic foraminifera at Maud Rise.
The rapid oxygen isotope excursion at a time when polar ice-sheets were absent or insignificant can be explained by an increase in temperature by 4–6°C of high latitude surface waters and deep waters world wide. The deep ocean temperature increase could have been caused by warming of surface waters at high latitudes and continued formation of the deep waters at these locations, or by a switch from dominant formation of deep waters at high latitudes to formation at lower latitudes. Benthic foraminiferal post-extinction biogeographical patterns favour the latter explanation.
The short-term carbon isotope excursion occurred in deep and surface waters, and in soil concretions and mammal teeth in the continental record. It is associated with increased CaCO3-dissolution over a wide depth range in the oceans, suggesting that a rapid transfer of isotopically light carbon from lithosphere or biosphere into the ocean-atmosphere system may have been involved. The rapidity of the initiation of the excursion (a few thousand years) and its short duration (50 000 years) suggest that such a transfer was probably not caused by changes in the ratio of organic carbon to carbonate deposition or erosion. Transfer of carbon from the terrestrial biosphere was probably not the cause, because it would require a much larger biosphere destruction than at the end of the Cretaceous, in conflict with the fossil record. It is difficult to explain the large shift by rapid emission into the atmosphere of volcanogenic CO2, although huge subaerial plateau basalt eruptions occurred at the time in the northern Atlantic. Probably a complex combination of processes and feedback was involved, including volcanogenic emission of CO2, changing circulation patterns, changing productivity in the oceans and possibly on land, and changes in the relative size of the oceanic and atmospheric carbon reservoirs.

The deep ocean temperature increase could have been caused by warming of surface waters at high latitudes and continued formation of the deep waters at these locations, or by a switch from dominant formation of deep waters at high latitudes to formation at lower latitudes. Benthic foraminiferal post-extinction biogeographical patterns favour the latter explanation.
The short-term carbon isotope excursion occurred in deep and surface waters, and in soil concretions and mammal teeth in the continental record. It is associated with increased CaCO3-dissolution over a wide depth range in the oceans, suggesting that a rapid transfer of isotopically light carbon from lithosphere or biosphere into the ocean-atmosphere system may have been involved. The rapidity of the initiation of the excursion (a few thousand years) and its short duration (50 000 years) suggest that such a transfer was probably not caused by changes in the ratio of organic carbon to carbonate deposition or erosion. Transfer of carbon from the terrestrial biosphere was probably not the cause, because it would require a much larger biosphere destruction than at the end of the Cretaceous, in conflict with the fossil record. It is difficult to explain the large shift by rapid emission into the atmosphere of volcanogenic CO2, although huge subaerial plateau basalt eruptions occurred at the time in the northern Atlantic. Probably a complex combination of processes and feedback was involved, including volcanogenic emission of CO2, changing circulation patterns, changing productivity in the oceans and possibly on land, and changes in the relative size of the oceanic and atmospheric carbon reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Isotopic records across the “Latest Paleocene Thermal Maximum“ (LPTM) indicate that bottom water temperature increased by more than 4°C during a brief time interval ({\textless}104 years) of the latest Paleocene (∼55.6 Ma). There also was a coeval −2 to −3‰ excursion in the δ13C of the ocean/atmosphere inorganic carbon reservoir. Given the large mass of this reservoir, a rapid δ13C shift of this magnitude is difficult to explain within the context of conventional hypotheses for changing the mean carbon isotope composition of the ocean and atmosphere. However, a direct consequence of warming bottom water temperature from 11 to 15°C over 104 years would be a significant change in sediment thermal gradients and dissociation of oceanic CH4 hydrate at locations with intermediate water depths. In terms of the present-day oceanic CH4 hydrate reservoir, thermal dissociation of oceanic CH4 hydrate during the LPTM could have released greater than 1.1 to 2.1 × 1018 g of carbon with a δ13C of approximately −60‰. The release and subsequent oxidation of this amount of carbon is sufficient to explain a −2 to −3‰ excursion in δ13C across the LPTM. Fate of CH4 in oceanic hydrates must be considered in developing models of the climatic and paleoceanographic regimes that operated during the LPTM.},

	abstract = {Measurements of sand flux and water flow in the Mississippi River are presented for a portion of the system 35–50 km upstream from the head of its subaerial delta. These data are used to provide insight into how nonuniform flow conditions, present in the lower reaches of large alluvial rivers, affect the timing and magnitude of sand transport near the river outlet. Field surveys during both low and high water discharge include (1) sequential digital bathymetric maps defining mobile river bottom topography which were used to estimate bed material flux, (2) multiple water velocity profiles, and (3) multiple suspended sediment profiles collected using a point-integrated sampler. These data show that total sand transport increases by two orders of magnitude over the measured range in water discharge (11,300 to 38,400 m3 s−1). During low water discharge no sand is measured in suspension, and sand discharge via bed form migration is minimal. During high water discharge 54\% of the sand discharge is measured in suspension while 46\% of the sand discharge is part of bed form migration. The component of boundary shear stress associated with moving this sediment is estimated using a set of established sediment transport algorithms, and values for the total boundary shear stress are predicted by fitting logarithmic velocity functions to the measured profiles. The estimates of boundary shear stress, using measurements of suspended sand transport, bed form transport, and downstream oriented velocity profiles are internally consistent; moreover, the analyses show that boundary shear stress increases by nearly 10-fold over the measured water discharge range. We show how this increase in shear stress is consistent with backwater flow arising where the river approaches its outlet. The hydrodynamic properties of backwater flow affect the timing and magnitude of sand flux and produce punctuated sand transport through the lowermost Mississippi River. Our field data are used to evaluate the influence of this sand transport style on development of the mixed bedrock alluvial channel for the lowermost Mississippi River.},

These zones are equivalent to planktonic foraminifera zone P5 and the lower part of zone P6 (sub-zone P6a). The succession was deposited in a lower bathyal slope environment at a palaeodepth of about 2000 m. Within the dominantly marlstone succession, a 5.5-m-thick intercalation of red and green claystone and marly claystone represents the global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) which is used to recognize the Palaeocene–Eocene boundary. The CIE was associated with a shallowing of the calcite compensation depth by at least 1 km. Throughout the section, clay mineral assemblages are dominated by smectite, indicating a seasonal climate with alternating wet and dry conditions. A 49\% increase in detrital quartz and feldspar within the CIE-interval suggests enhanced continental run-off. This was probably the result of the establishment of a monsoonal setting, in which vegetation was sparse, while periodic high rainfall caused pronounced sediment transport. The increased terrestrially derived input is associated with abundant radiolarian casts indicating high primary productivity. This suggests that seasonal nutrient pulses resulting from intensified precipitation during the wet season have caused high surface-water fertility. The benthic foraminifera faunas of the samples rich in siliceous plankton are strongly dominated by Glomospira spp., Nuttalides truempyii, Abyssamina poagi, Anomalinoides praeacutus, Anomalinoides nobilis, and Oridorsalis spp. We assume that the Glomospira–Nuttalides fauna consists of opportunistic species which quickly react to seasonally varying amounts of food. The calcareous nannoplankton assemblage of the CIE-interval is characterized by the first occurrences of the genus Rhomboaster and of Discoaster araneus and Discoaster mahmoudii, whereas Scapholithus apertus become extinct at the Palaeocene–Eocene boundary. Within nannoplankton sub-zone NP10a, a series of primarily basaltic ashes give evidence for a major episode of explosive volcanism which can be correlated with the positive ash-series of the Fur-Formation in northern Denmark. The wide dispersal distance of the tephras implies Plinian-scale eruptions and multiple ejections of large volumes of pyroclastic material.},

The same trend is recognized in published records from other sites around the world. Together, the data indicate a eustatic rise during the PETM, beginning 20 to 200 ka before the globally recorded negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) at ∼55.5 Ma. Although correlations are tentative, we recognize other global transgressions during Chrons C25n and C24n. The latter may be associated with Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (∼53.5 Ma) or the “X”-event (∼52 Ma). These results suggest a link between global sea level and “hyperthermal” intervals, potentially because of the melting of small alpine ice sheets on Antarctica, thermal expansion of seawater, or both.

Here, we present stable isotope, carbonate content, organic matter content, and C:N ratio records through the PETM from new outcrop sections in California and from cores previously drilled on the New Jersey margin. Foraminifer δ18O data suggest that midlatitude shelves warmed by a similar magnitude as the open ocean (5°C–8°C), while the carbon isotope excursion (CIE), recorded both in carbonate and organic matter δ13C records, is slightly larger (3.3–4.5‰) than documented in open ocean records. Sediment accumulation rates increase dramatically during the CIE in marked contrast to the open ocean sites. In parallel, mass accumulation rates of both organic and inorganic carbon also increased by an order of magnitude. The estimated total mass of accumulated carbon in excess of pre-CIE rates suggests that continental margins, at least along North America, became carbon sinks during the CIE, mainly because of weathering feedbacks and rising sea level. This result is significant because it implies that the negative feedback role of carbon burial on continental margins was greater than previously recognized.},

This apparent decrease in sediment deposition has been attributed to completeness of the sedimentary record; the effect arises because of incorporation of longer hiatuses in deposition as averaging time is increased. We demonstrate that a heavy-tailed distribution of periods of nondeposition (hiatuses) produces this phenomenon and that observed accumulation rate decreases as tγ−1, over multiple orders of magnitude, where 0 {\textless} γ ≤ 1 is the parameter describing the tail of the distribution of quiescent period length. By using continuous time random walks and limit theory, we can estimate the actual average deposition rate from observations of the surface location over time. If geologic and geometric constraints place an upper limit on the length of hiatuses, then average accumulation rates approach a constant value at very long times. Our model suggests an alternative explanation for the apparent increase in global sediment accumulation rates over the last 5 million years.},

	abstract = {Manifestations of profound perturbations in biogeochemical systems during the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) include a prominent global negative δ13C and a pronounced increase in the relative abundance of dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) assigned to the genus Apectodinium. While motile representatives of Apectodinium were most likely thermophilic and heterotrophic, the underlying causes of this dinoflagellate response are not well understood. Here we provide new insight by examining the palynology, chemistry and calcareous nannoplankton across the PETM in a continental slope section at Tawanui, New Zealand. Across the PETM, marked changes in the relative abundance of Apectodinium vary antithetically with significant changes in the δ13C of carbonate and organic matter. In general, the high relative abundance of Apectodinium relates to enhanced concentrations of dinocysts, signifying a ‘bloom’ of Apectodinium in surface waters during the PETM. Changes in Apectodinium and δ13C records correspond to variations in many other parameters, including a smaller negative shift in bulk carbonate δ13C than expected, increased terrestrial palynomorphs, elevated TOC and C/N ratios, lower carbonate contents, higher SiO2 and Al2O3 contents, and lower Si/Al ratios. All of these variations can be explained by an increase in delivery of terrigenous material to the continental margin. A peak in the relative abundance of Glaphyrocysta dinocysts at the onset of the PETM may indicate greater down slope transport of neritic material. Changes in calcareous nannoplankton abundances suggest increased nutrient availability in surface waters during the PETM. The combined results show that Apectodinium-dominated assemblages, global perturbations in carbon isotopes and enhanced terrigenous delivery closely correspond in time at Tawanui. A sudden and massive carbon injection to the ocean–atmosphere system may have enhanced weathering and increased terrigenous inputs to continental margins during the PETM. We further suggest that these inputs caused the Apectodinium acme by elevating primary productivity in marginal seas.},

	abstract = {Despite the large number of studies on the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), the knowledge of environmental and biotic responses in shallow marine environments remains quite poor. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages of the Sidi Nasseur and Wadi Mezaz sections in Tunisia were studied quantitatively and the paleoecologic interpretations provide new insights into the complex relationship between PETM global warming and perturbations of shallow marine settings. These sections expose upper Paleocene to lower Eocene shales and marls of the El Haria Formation up to the phosphate layers of the Chouabine Formation underlying the El Garia limestones. The Sidi Nasseur section contains a more complete and expanded Paleocene–Eocene boundary interval compared to Wadi Mezaz, although being truncated at the top. The Wadi Mezaz section contains a more complete post-PETM interval. The studied interval can be subdivided into a sequence of 4 biofacies, representing respectively a latest Paleocene biofacies, two PETM biofacies and one post-PETM Eocene biofacies. The latest Paleocene biofacies 1 consists of numerous calcareous benthic foraminifera (e.g. Anomalinoides midwayensis, Frondicularia aff. phosphatica and various Bulimina and Lenticulina species), abundant non-calcareous taxa (Haplophragmoides) and rare planktic foraminifera, indicating a slightly hypersaline eutrophic inner neritic to coastal environment, regularly interrupted by oxygen deficiency (moderate dysoxia). During the latest Paleocene, this highly productive environment shallowed as indicated by the increasing abundances of A. midwayensis. The variable dominance of non-calcareous agglutinated taxa in biofacies 1 indicates post-mortem dissolution effects. The TOC δ13Corg record reveals a sharp negative excursion, marking the base of the Eocene. In general, the absence of lithologic changes, an increasing sedimentation rate and absence of reworking indicate that the initial part of the PETM is complete and expanded in the Sidi Nasseur section. A sharp faunal turnover coincides with this negative δ13Corg excursion and is characterized by the disappearance or diminution of common Paleocene taxa in this area. During the PETM, benthic foraminifera are less abundant and consist of opportunistic non-calcareous taxa together with deeper dwelling (middle neritic) lagenids and buliminids (biofacies 2 and 3). Planktic foraminifera, dominated by flat-spired Acarinina (mainly A. multicamerata), become more abundant, as observed in many open marine sequences worldwide. All these faunal parameters suggest more stressed probably severe dysoxic sea floor conditions within a transgressive phase during the onset of the PETM. An estimation of the total duration of the Sidi Nasseur PETM interval is difficult to establish, yet the lack of recovery carbon isotope values suggests that the preserved PETM interval reflects only a part of the CIE “core”. The top of the PETM interval is truncated due to local (?) erosion during the early Eocene. The Eocene recovery fauna is mainly composed of Lenticulina and Stainforthia species (biofacies 4), indicating restricted coastal to hyposaline lagoonal eutrophic conditions, distinctly different from earlier environmental conditions.},

Here we question the validity of most such data on the grounds of poor preservation and diagenetic alteration. We present new data from exceptionally well preserved foraminifer shells extracted from impermeable clay-rich sediments, which indicate that for the intervals studied, tropical sea surface temperatures were at least 28–32 °C. These warm temperatures are more in line with our understanding of the geographical distributions of temperature-sensitive fossil organisms and the results of climate models with increased CO2 levels.},

	abstract = {The Early Eocene Climate Optimum (EECO, which occurred about 51 to 53 million years ago)1, was the warmest interval of the past 65 million years, with mean annual surface air temperature over ten degrees Celsius warmer than during the pre-industrial period2,3,4. Subsequent global cooling in the middle and late Eocene epoch, especially at high latitudes, eventually led to continental ice sheet development in Antarctica in the early Oligocene epoch (about 33.6 million years ago). However, existing estimates place atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels during the Eocene at 500–3,000 parts per million5,6,7, and in the absence of tighter constraints carbon–climate interactions over this interval remain uncertain. Here we use recent analytical and methodological developments8,9,10,11 to generate a new high-fidelity record of CO2 concentrations using the boron isotope (δ11B) composition of well preserved planktonic foraminifera from the Tanzania Drilling Project, revising previous estimates6. Although species-level uncertainties make absolute values difficult to constrain, CO2 concentrations during the EECO were around 1,400 parts per million. The relative decline in CO2 concentration through the Eocene is more robustly constrained at about fifty per cent, with a further decline into the Oligocene12. Provided the latitudinal dependency of sea surface temperature change for a given climate forcing in the Eocene was similar to that of the late Quaternary period13, this CO2 decline was sufficient to drive the well documented high- and low-latitude cooling that occurred through the Eocene14. Once the change in global temperature between the pre-industrial period and the Eocene caused by the action of all known slow feedbacks (apart from those associated with the carbon cycle) is removed2,3,4, both the EECO and the late Eocene exhibit an equilibrium climate sensitivity relative to the pre-industrial period of 2.1 to 4.6 degrees Celsius per CO2 doubling (66 per cent confidence), which is similar to the canonical range (1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius15), indicating that a large fraction of the warmth of the early Eocene greenhouse was driven by increased CO2 concentrations, and that climate sensitivity was relatively constant throughout this period.},

These values of X imply that concentrations of CO2 gas in the paleosol were ≈7400 to ≈34,000 ppm. δ13C and 1/X are correlated and define a linear, soil-CO2 diffusive mixing line with a positive slope. Such positive slopes are characteristic of mixing of two isotopically distinct CO2 endmembers (atmospheric CO2 and CO2 from oxidation of soil organic matter). From the intercept of the mixing line, it is calculated that the δ 13C value of organic matter in the ancient soil was ≈−28.0‰. The magnitude of the slope implies an Early Eocene atmospheric CO2 concentration of ≈2700 ppm. A simple model for forest soils suggests that a “canopy effect” may cause atmospheric CO2 concentrations deduced from pedogenic minerals to underestimate the actual concentrations of atmospheric CO2. If a significant forest canopy were present at the time of formation of pedogenic goethite in the Ione Fm, the concentration of 2700 ppm calculated for atmospheric CO2 could be slightly low, but the underestimate is expected to be {\textless} ≈300 ppm (i.e., less than the analytical uncertainty). The relatively high concentration of 2700 ppm inferred for atmospheric CO2 at ≈52 Ma B.P. would have been coincident with the Early Eocene climatic optimum. This result seems to support the case for an important role for variations of atmospheric CO2 in the modification of global paleoclimate.},

Analogous changes have been reported for an episode of millennial-scale 5 °C warming, termed the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; 56 Ma), providing independent constraints on hydrological response to global warming. However, quantifying hydrologic extremes during geologic global warming analogs has proven difficult. Here we show that water discharge increased by at least 1.35 and potentially up to 14 times during the early phase of the PETM in northern Spain. We base these estimates on analyses of channel dimensions, sediment grain size, and palaeochannel gradients across the early PETM, which is regionally marked by an abrupt transition from overbank palaeosol deposits to conglomeratic fluvial sequences. We infer that extreme floods and channel mobility quickly denuded surrounding soil-mantled landscapes, plausibly enhanced by regional vegetation decline, and exported enormous quantities of terrigenous material towards the ocean. These results support hypotheses that extreme rainfall events and associated risks of flooding increase with global warming at similar, but potentially at much higher, magnitudes than currently predicted.},

	abstract = {Proxy-based climate reconstructions suggest the existence of a strongly reduced equator-to-pole temperature gradient during the Azolla interval in the Early/Middle Eocene, compared to modern. Changes in the hydrological cycle, as a consequence of a reduced temperature gradient, are expected to be reflected in the isotopic composition of precipitation (δD, δ18O). The interpretation of water isotopic records to quantitatively reconstruct past precipitation patterns is, however, hampered by a lack of detailed information on changes in their spatial and temporal distribution. Using the isotope-enabled version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) atmospheric general circulation model, Community Atmosphere Model v.3 (isoCAM3), relationships between water isotopes and past climates can be simulated. Here we examine the influence of an imposed reduced meridional sea surface temperature gradient on the spatial distribution of precipitation and its isotopic composition in an Early/Middle Eocene setting. As a result of the applied forcings, the Eocene simulation predicts the occurrence of less depleted high latitude precipitation, with δD values ranging only between 0 and −140‰ (compared to Present-day 0 to −300‰). Comparison with Early/Middle Eocene-age isotopic proxy data shows that the simulation accurately captures the main features of the spatial distribution of the isotopic composition of Early/Middle Eocene precipitation over land in conjunction with the aspects of the modeled Early/Middle Eocene climate. Hence, the included stable isotope module quantitatively supports the existence of a reduced meridional temperature gradient during this interval.},

	abstract = {In a companion paper (Liang et al., 2015) we introduced a reduced-complexity model (RCM) for river delta formation, developed using a parcel-based "weighted random walk" method for routing water and sediment flux. This model (referred to as DeltaRCM) consists of a flow routing scheme as the hydrodynamic component (referred to as FlowRCM) and a set of sediment transport rules as the morphodynamic component. In this work, we assess the performance of FlowRCM via a series of hydrodynamic tests by comparing the model outputs to Delft3D and theoretical predictions. These tests are designed to reveal the capability of FlowRCM to resolve flow field features that are critical to delta dynamics at the level of channel processes. In particular, we focus on (1) backwater profile, (2) flow around a mouth bar, (3) flow through a single bifurcation, and (4) flow through a distributary channel network. We show that while the simple rules are not able to reproduce all fine-scale flow structures, FlowRCM captures flow field features that are essential to deltaic processes such as bifurcations and avulsions, the partitioning of flux between channels and inundated islands, and the instability of flux distribution at channel mouths which is responsible for mouth-bar growth. Finally, we discuss advantages and limitations of FlowRCM and identify environments most suitable for it.},

A central challenge in accurately interpreting the sedimentary archive is determining what scales and types of deposits reflect autogenic controls on sedimentation in different environments. Autogenic sediment-transport dynamics commonly result from intermittent sediment storage in transient landforms, which produces episodic, spatially discontinuous sedimentation across a basin. The transition from localized, variable sedimentation to even, basin-wide sedimentation marks the shift from stochastic landscape dynamics to deterministic deposition responding to the long-term balance between sediment supply and the creation of space to accommodate sediment. This threshold can be measured in a wide variety of stratigraphic successions and has important bearing on whether climatic, tectonic, or sea level signals can be recognized in physical sedimentary deposits.},

	abstract = {The effects of climate change on eroding landscapes and the terrestrial sedimentary record are poorly understood. Using mountain catchment–alluvial fan systems as simple analogues for larger landscapes, a wide range of theoretical studies, numerical models and physical experiments have hypothesized that a change in precipitation rate could leave a characteristic signal in alluvial fan sediment flux, grain size and down-system fining rate. However, this hypothesis remains largely untested in real landscapes. This study measures grain-size fining rates from apex to toe on two alluvial fan systems in northern Death Valley, California, USA, which each have well-exposed modern and ca 70 ka surfaces, and where the long-term tectonic boundary conditions can be constrained. Between them, these surfaces capture a well-constrained temporal gradient in climate. A grain-size fining model is adapted, based on self-similarity and selective deposition, for application to these alluvial fans. This model is then integrated with cosmogenic nuclide constraints on catchment erosion rates, and observed grain-size fining data from two catchment-fan systems, to estimate the change in sediment flux from canyon to alluvial fan that occurred between mid-glacial and modern interglacial conditions. In a fan system with negligible sediment recycling, a ca 30\% decrease in precipitation rate led to a 20\% decrease in sediment flux and a clear increase in the down-fan rate of fining, supporting existing landscape evolution models. Consequently, this study shows that small mountain catchments and their alluvial fan stratigraphy can be highly sensitive to orbital climate changes over {\textless}105 year timescales. However, in the second fan system it is observed that this sensitivity is completely lost when sediment is remobilized and recycled over a time period longer than the duration of the climatic perturbation. These analyses offer a new approach to quantitatively reconstructing the effects of past climate changes on sedimentation, using simple grain-size data measured in the field.},

These experiments reproduce the range of observed field morphologies, varying from wholesale bevelling of the uplifting fold to the formation of narrow, steep-walled canyons. A log-linear fit to a simple dimensionless parameter shows that the competition between lateral channel mobility and rock-uplift rate explains {\textgreater}95\% of the variance in the bevelled fraction of the folds. Our data suggest that lateral bedrock erosion rates of 0.5–40 m yr−1 are required to explain the formation of extensive platforms in the Tian Shan foreland and imply that varying water and sediment fluxes can cause striking changes in the degree of landscape flattening by influencing the lateral erosion rate.},

In this paper we explore, through the use of physical and numerical experiments, the forward problem, that is, we quantify how the probabilistic structure of the processes that govern the evolution of depositional systems relates to the probability distribution of the preserved bed thicknesses. We demonstrate that the extreme variability, as evidenced by heavy-tailed distribution of the surface elevation increments, largely cancels itself out in the resulting stratigraphy. Specifically, we show that bed thickness is well described by an exponential distribution even when erosional and depositional increments characterizing the surface evolution exhibit heavy-tailed statistics, i.e., large, infrequent events have a significant chance of occurrence. We attribute this finding to the symmetric nature of the distribution of elevation increments (both erosional and depositional events) and the additive nature of the stratigraphic filter. We also show that the variability of surface elevation increments, as measured by the interquartile range of their probability distribution, has a robust and well-defined relationship with the preserved mean bed thickness.},

	abstract = {Changes in external forcing have traditionally been the main areas of interest in understanding sedimentary records, while in most stratigraphic interpretation, autogenic behavior has been thought of as a “noise” generator. This study aims to investigate autogenic processes in a fluvio-deltaic system under a range of discharge conditions and to show that autogenic processes generate distinct signatures rather than random noise. A matrix of nine different experiments is presented here to systematically evaluate the effects of sediment and water discharge variations on the timescale of fluvial autogenic processes. Temporary sediment storage regularly occurs by backfilling of sediment in the fluvio-deltaic channels, followed by a period of strong channelization that releases the stored sediment. These storage and release processes cycle along with changes in the fluvial slope and planform pattern of the flow. Here we propose that the autogenic behavior of deltaic progradation has a distinct timescale that is controlled by sediment and water discharges. An increase in sediment discharge primarily reduces the autogenic timescale as higher sediment supply fills the channels faster. In contrast, the high sediment discharge causes a morphologic feedback by increasing the magnitude of fluvial slope change between the storage and release events and increasing the size of the temporary sediment storage (termed “the fluvial envelope”). This works against the sediment discharge control as the autogenic timescale is increased. Increasing the water discharge increases the autogenic timescale by improving the fluvial organization toward a strongly channelized system. Changes in autogenic timescale due to variations in the sediment and water discharges are nonlinear for different sediment to water discharge ratios. As the ratio decreases, the fluvial system is better organized and the timescale is more linearly related to the change in sediment discharge. As the ratio increases, deltas develop poorly organized fluvial systems and the associated timescales converge even with different sediment discharges. The results presented here provide enhanced interpretation of sedimentary records by better decoupling of autogenic signatures from allogenic products developed across a wide range of discharge conditions.},

The durations of depositional and erosional events, as well as their magnitudes, control the structure of the stratigraphic record. In this study, we use high-resolution temporal surface elevation data from a controlled experiment to quantify the probability distributions of the processes that govern the evolution of depositional deltaic systems. Heavy-tailed statistics of erosional and depositional events are documented, indicating that a small but significant chance exists for the occurrence of extreme events. We show that the periods of inactivity, when neither deposition nor erosion occurs, follow a truncated Pareto distribution whose truncation scale is set by the mean characteristic avulsion time scale in the system. Further, we show that the heavy tails in the magnitudes of the erosional and depositional events are not preserved in the stratigraphic record, resulting instead in an exponential distribution for the bed sediment thickness. It is also shown that the temporal evolution of surface elevation exhibits self-similarity with a nonlinear spectrum of scaling exponents (multifractality) quantifying the complex dynamics of the system. Finally, we show how the results of this study can lead to improved diffusional models for surface evolution using the tools of fractional calculus.},

Simplified modeling approaches, such as cellular models and process-analogue experiments, are particularly useful for efficiently exploring alternative hypotheses and evaluating first-order controls on river avulsion and alluvial architecture. Here we review the history and current state of the art in simplified avulsion and alluvial architecture models, with a particular focus on how results and insights from these models can be incorporated into field and subsurface studies, and vice versa. Simplified avulsion and alluvial architecture models have proliferated in the past decade, providing a wide variety of models to serve as a basis for future coupled field-modeling studies. We compare features of leading models and discuss avenues for effectively pairing model capabilities with hypotheses and field data. Outstanding questions highlighted by recent modeling efforts include 1) What thresholds control avulsion initiation in different systems? 2) How do floodplain processes and topography influence avulsion dynamics and alluvial architecture? 3) What factors determine where avulsion channels stabilize? Answering these questions will require targeted modeling efforts coupled to data from ancient systems. Hence our model comparison emphasizes features that can be used to choose or design fit-for-purpose models, and we outline how quantitative data useful for model selection and validation can be obtained from modern systems and ancient deposits. Matching model goals with targeted questions, and model parameters and predictions with quantitative field data, will help tighten communication between field- and model-oriented sedimentary geologists, facilitating advances in our understanding of river avulsion and alluvial architecture.},

The geomorphic and stratigraphic products of this source-to-sink sediment transfer record signals of external environmental forcings, as well as internal, or autogenic, dynamics of the sedimentary system. Here, we evaluate environmental signal propagation across sediment-routing systems with emphasis on sediment supply, Qs, as the carrier of up-system forcings. We review experimental, numerical, and natural examples of source-to-sink sediment routing and signal propagation during three timescales: (1) historic, which includes measurement and monitoring of events and processes of landscape change and deposition during decades to centuries; (2) centuries to several millions of years, referred to as intermediate timescale; and (3) deep time. We discuss issues related to autogenic dynamics of sediment transport, transient storage, and release that can introduce noise, lags, and/or completely mask signals of external environmental forcings. We provide a set of conceptual and practical tools for evaluating sediment supply within a source-to-sink context, which can inform interpretations of signals from the sedimentary record. These tools include stratigraphic and sediment-routing system characterization, sediment budgets, geochronology, detrital mineral analysis (e.g., thermochronology), comparative analog approaches, and modeling techniques to measure, calculate, or estimate the magnitude and frequency of external forcings compared to the characteristic response time of the sediment-routing systems.},

	abstract = {The growth of quantitative analysis and prediction in Earth-surface science has been accompanied by growth in experimental stratigraphy and geomorphology. Experimenters have grown increasingly bold in targeting landscape elements from channel reaches up to the entire erosional networks and depositional basins, often using very small facilities. The experiments produce spatial structure and kinematics that, although imperfect, compare well with natural systems despite differences of spatial scale, time scale, material properties, and number of active processes. Experiments have been particularly useful in studying a wide range of forms of self-organized (autogenic) complexity that occur in morphodynamic systems. Autogenic dynamics creates much of the spatial structure we see in the landscape and in preserved strata, and is strongly associated with sediment storage and release. The observed consistency between experimental and field systems despite large differences in governing dimensionless numbers is what we mean by “unreasonable effectiveness”. We suggest that unreasonable experimental effectiveness arises from natural scale independence. We generalize existing ideas to relate internal similarity, in which a small part of a system is similar to the larger system, to external similarity, in which a small copy of a system is similar to the larger system. We propose that internal similarity implies external similarity, though not the converse. The external similarity of landscape experiments to natural landscapes suggests that natural scale independence may be even more characteristic of morphodynamics than it is of better studied cases such as turbulence. We urge a shift in emphasis in experimental stratigraphy and geomorphology away from classical dynamical scaling and towards a quantitative understanding of the origins and limits of scale independence. Other research areas with strong growth potential in experimental surface dynamics include physical–biotic interactions, cohesive effects, stochastic processes, the interplay of structural and geomorphic self-organization, extraction of quantitative process information from landscape and stratigraphic records, and closer interaction between experimentation and theory.},

The compensation statistic is a quantitative tool that has been used to estimate scales and patterns of autogenic sedimentation in experimental deposits; it has been applied to a few outcrop studies, but its sensitivity to data limitations common in natural deposits remains unconstrained. To explore how the compensation statistic may be applied to outcrop data, we evaluate the sensitivity of the tool to stratigraphic data sets limited in extent and resolution by subsampling an autogenic experimental deposit to create pseudo-outcrop-scale data sets. Results show that for data sets more than 3 times thicker than a characteristic depositional element (e.g., channel or lobe), the compensation statistics that can be used reliably constrain the maximum scale of autogenic sedimentation even for low-resolution data sets. Additionally, we show that autogenic sedimentation patterns may be characterized as persistent, random, or compensational using the compensation statistic when data sets are high resolution. We demonstrate how these measurements can be applied to natural data sets with comparative case studies of two fluvial and two deltaic outcrops. These case studies show how the compensation statistic can provide insight into what controls the maximum scale of autogenic sedimentation in different systems and how landscape dynamics can produce organized sedimentation patterns over long time scales.},

The formative conditions for crevasse splays are not well understood, yet such river sediment diversions form an integral part of billion-dollar coastal restoration projects. Here we use Delft3D to investigate the influence of vegetation and soil consolidation on the evolution of a natural-levee breach. Model simulations show that crevasse splays heal because floodplain aggradation reduces the water surface slope, decreasing water discharge into the flood basin. Easily erodible and unvegetated floodplains increase the likelihood for channel avulsions. Denser vegetation and less potential for soil consolidation result in small crevasse splays that are not only efficient sediment traps but also short-lived. Successful crevasse splays that generate the largest land area gain for the imported sediment require a delicate balance between water and sediment discharge, vegetation root strength, and soil consolidation.},

	abstract = {AbstractStratigraphy contains the most complete record of information necessary to quantitatively reconstruct paleolandscape dynamics, but this record contains significant gaps over a range of time and space scales. These gaps result from stasis on geomorphic surfaces and erosional events that remove previously deposited sediment. Building on earlier statistical studies, we examine stratigraphic completeness in three laboratory experiments where the topography of aggrading deltas was monitored at high temporal and spatial scales. The three experiments cover unique combinations in the absolute magnitudes of sediment and water discharge in addition to generation of accommodation space through base-level rise. This analysis centers on three time scales: (1) the time at which a record is discretized (t), (2) the time necessary to build a deposit with mean thickness equivalent to the maximum roughness on a surface (Tc), and (3) the time necessary for channelized flow to migrate over all locations in a basin (Tch). These time scales incorporate information pertaining to the time-variant topography of actively changing surfaces, kinematics by which the surfaces are changing, and net deposition rate. We find that stratigraphic completeness increases as a function of t/Tc but decreases as a function of Tc/Tch over the parameter space covered in the experiments. Our results suggest that environmental signals disconnected from a sediment routing system are best preserved in systems with low Tc values. Nondimensionalizing t by Tc, however, shows that preservation of information characterizing system morphodynamics is best preserved in stratigraphy constructed by systems with low water to sediment flux ratios.},

It is a rule-based cellular morphodynamic model, in contrast to reductionist models based on detailed computational ﬂuid dynamics. The basic framework of this model (DeltaRCM) consists of stochastic parcel-based cellular routing schemes for water and sediment and a set of phenomenological rules for sediment deposition and erosion. The outputs of the model include a depth-averaged ﬂow ﬁeld, water surface elevation and bed topography that evolve in time. Results show that DeltaRCM is able (1) to resolve a wide range of channel dynamics – including elongation, bifurcation, avulsion and migration – and (2) to produce a variety of deltas such as alluvial fan deltas and deltas with multiple orders of bifurcations. We also demonstrate a simple stratigraphy recording component which tracks the distribution of coarse and ﬁne materials and the age of the deposits. Essential processes that must be included in reduced-complexity delta models include a depth-averaged ﬂow ﬁeld that guides sediment transport a nontrivial water surface proﬁle that accounts for backwater effects at least in the main channels, both bedload and suspended sediment transport, and topographic steering of sediment transport.},

We perform numerical experiments with a parcel-based cellular model to analyze the deltaic surface and subsurface responses to regional subsidence. We quantify model results using robust metrics and show that while sediment partitioning and shoreline pattern vary gradually with increasing subsidence rate, channel mobility and stratigraphic connectivity of channel deposits show a threshold transition. Conditions for this transition are captured with a dimensionless filling index β, defined as the ratio between the rates of accommodation creation and sediment supply. A channel-locking mechanism activates when β exceeds 0.6 and is responsible for the threshold transition.},

	abstract = {Understanding deltaic channel dynamics is essential to acquiring knowledge on how deltas respond to environmental changes, as channels control the distribution of water, sediment, and nutrients. Channel-resolving morphodynamic models provide the basis for quantitative study of channel-scale dynamics, but they need to be properly assessed with a set of robust metrics able to quantitatively characterize delta patterns and dynamics before being used as predictive tools. In this work we use metrics developed in the context of delta formation, to assess the morphodynamic results of DeltaRCM, a parcel-based cellular model for delta formation and evolution. By comparing model results to theoretical predictions and field and experimental observations, we show that DeltaRCM captures the geometric growth characteristics of deltas such as fractality of channel network, spatial distribution of wet and dry surfaces, and temporal dynamics of channel-scale processes such as the decay of channel planform correlation. After evaluating the ability of DeltaRCM to produce delta patterns and dynamics at the scale of channel processes, we use the model to predict the deltaic response to relative sea level rise (RSLR). We show that uniform subsidence and absolute sea level rise have similar effects on delta evolution and cause intensified channel branching. Channel network fractality and channel mobility increase with higher-RSLR rates, while the spatial and temporal scales of avulsion events decrease, resulting in smaller sand bodies in the stratigraphy. Our modeling results provide the first set of quantitative predictions of the effects of RSLR on river deltas with a specific focus on the distributary channel network.},

	abstract = {The dynamics between sediment erosion and accumulation at an alluvial basin margin affected by changes in the surface hydrology are explored using scaled analogue models produced in a flume. The presented results differ from previous counterparts in that accumulation or erosion has not been forced at a spreading outlet, but occurred at a slope change produced by previously accumulated sediment. Cyclical upstream incision produced by increased stream discharge generated incised valleys, and these were subsequently filled by sediment carried by less efficient streams generated during the low discharge period. High resolution mapping using 2.5 mm contour maps allowed the study of sediment accumulation and terrain modelling. The results of three selected experiments are analysed. The only variable explored was discharge. The basin margin was simulated by a ramp inserted in a low sloping flume, consisting of two segments of different slopes selected to emulate high and low efficiency flume fans produced elsewhere. Water and fine-medium sand entered the ramp along a narrow (0.1 m) channel and flow expanded but without occupying the complete 1.2 m flume width. Flows were highly concentrated and noncohesive. Fan-like accumulation (slope: 0.11) began during low discharge (LD) periods at the ramp slope break, and proceeded upstream, onlapping quickly at first, but shifting to mostly progradation at the end of the period. High discharges (HD) usually generated two or three incised channels at the beginning of the period, but one of them prevailed and rapidly eroded parts of the LD fan and moved the sediment to a more distal low-sloping fan (slope: 0.045). Both LD and HD fans passed downstream into a system of small parallel channels resembling a braided alluvial plain ending in sediment lobes. The mapping of the accumulated sediment during the various periods allowed calculation of sediment budgets for the entire flume. The stratal architecture of the deposits was investigated along five parallel trenches cut after experiment termination. The regression analysis of depositional profiles at fan-like features (expanding flow) and at braided plains (parallel flow) indicated that these fan-like systems are linear and dependent on applied discharge, while the latter showed an exponential decrease of slope downstream, with a starting value set up by the fan slope. Two main types of stratigraphic units were generated, the LDST and HDST (system tracts). The LDST has a nonerosive base over `bedrock' and the previous HDST, filling proximal erosional topography and prograding as well, generating an onlap±downlap array. Its geometry is highly variable and dependent on pre-existing topography. The HDST base is an important erosive surface comparable to sequence boundaries. However, there are places without erosion due to a marginal position with respect to the main stream. Indeed, the results suggest that the three-dimensional variability of erosion and depositional processes might produce very different architectures along the same basin margin.},

	abstract = {From a societal, weather, and climate perspective, precipitation intensity, duration, frequency, and phase are as much of concern as total amounts, as these factors determine the disposition of precipitation once it hits the ground and how much runs off. At the extremes of precipitation incidence are the events that give rise to floods and droughts, whose changes in occurrence and severity have an enormous impact on the environment and society. Hence, advancing understanding and the ability to model and predict the character of precipitation is vital but requires new approaches to examining data and models. Various mechanisms, storms and so forth, exist to bring about precipitation. Because the rate of precipitation, conditional on when it falls, greatly exceeds the rate of replenishment of moisture by surface evaporation, most precipitation comes from moisture already in the atmosphere at the time the storm begins, and transport of moisture by the storm-scale circulation into the storm is vital. Hence, the intensity of precipitation depends on available moisture, especially for heavy events. As climate warms, the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, which is governed by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation, is expected to rise much faster than the total precipitation amount, which is governed by the surface heat budget through evaporation. This implies that the main changes to be experienced are in the character of precipitation: increases in intensity must be offset by decreases in duration or frequency of events. The timing, duration, and intensity of precipitation can be systematically explored via the diurnal cycle, whose correct simulation in models remains an unsolved challenge of vital importance in global climate change. Typical problems include the premature initiation of convection, and precipitation events that are too light and too frequent. These challenges in observations, modeling, and understanding precipitation changes are being taken up in the NCAR “Water Cycle Across Scales” initiative, which will exploit the diurnal cycle as a test bed for a hierarchy of models to promote improvements in models.},

	abstract = {Quantitative evaluation of fluvial response to allogenic controls is crucial for further progress in understanding the stratigraphic record in terms of processes that control landscape evolution. For instance, without quantitative insight into time lags that are known to exist between sea-level change and fluvial response, there is no way to relate fluvial stratigraphy to the sea-level curve. It is difficult to put firm constraints on these time-lag relationships on the basis of empirical studies. Therefore, we have started to quantify time-averaged erosion and deposition in the fluvial and offshore realms in response to sea-level change by means of analogue modelling in a 4r8-m flume tank. The rate of sea-level change was chosen as an independent variable, with other factors such as sediment supply, discharge and initial geometry kept constant over the course of 18 experiments. Our experimental results support the common view that neither fall nor rise in sea level affects the upstream fluvial system instantaneously. An important cause for the delayed fluvial response is that a certain amount of time is required to connect initial incisions on the newly emergent shelf (canyons) with the fluvial valley. Lowering of the fluvial longitudinal profile starts only after the connection of an active shelf canyon with the fluvial valley; until that moment the profile remains steady. We quantified the process of connection and introduced the quantity `connection rate{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}'. It controlled, in conjunction with the rate of sea-level fall: (1) the amount of fluvial degradation during sea-level fall; (2) the total sediment volume that bypasses the shelf edge; (3) the percentage of fluvial relative to shelf sediment in the lowstand delta; (4) the volume of the transgressive systems tract and (5) the amount of diachroneity along the sequence boundary. Our experiments demonstrate also that the sequence-stratigraphic concept is difficult to apply to continental successions, even when these successions have been deposited within the influence of sea level.},

	abstract = {We have shown in a previous paper that many of the main features of braided streams can be captured in a relatively simple cellular computer model. Here we examine some of the detailed characteristics of this model. We show the qualitative form of the braiding produced by the model is generally insensitive to changes in most of the numerical parameters used in the model. The most crucial parameter choice is the use of a non-linear exponent ({\textgreater}1) to describe the relation between sediment flux and local stream power. Use of water discharge instead of stream power to parameterize sediment flux produces braiding, but also unrealistically high-amplitude topography variations in the long term. Introduction of a threshold transport condition causes no noticeable change in the model's behaviour. Inclusion of lateral sediment transport due to gravitational effects on lateral slopes is not crucial to produce braiding, but is needed to provide reasonable lateral channel shifting, and to maintain a continuing dynamic behaviour. As long as lateral sediment transport is included, altering the initial topography for a run has no effect, other than a transient period of regrading. In addition, we show that there is a simple and apparently fundamental connection between braided-stream channel networks and erosional (dendritic) networks that has not been previously recognized. All that is needed to switch the model from braided to dendritic patterns is either to remove redeposition from the rules, simulating entrainment of cohesive sediment, or to add a cliff to the initial topography, making local redeposition unimportant. This result suggests that the presence or absence of significant local redeposition, which causes bar formation, channel division, and avulsion, determines whether a braided or dendritic pattern will form. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The dynamics of such networks are complex; channels migrate laterally, split, rejoin and develop bars, with the flow shifting unpredictably from one part of the network to another. Many processes are known to operate in a braided river13, but it is unclear which of these are essential to explain the observed dynamics. We describe here a simple, deterministic numerical model of water flow over a cohesionless bed that captures the main spatial and temporal features of real braided rivers. The patterns arise from local scour and deposition caused by a nonlinear dependence of bedload sediment flux on water discharge. Although the morphology of the resulting network depends in detail on the sediment-transport rule used in the model, our results suggest that the only factors essential for braiding are bedload sediment transport and laterally unconstrained free-surface flow.},

	abstract = {We compare the present-day sediment discharge (solid phase) of some of the largest rivers in Asia to the average discharge deduced from the mass accumulated in several sedimentary basins during the Quaternary. There is a very good correlation, especially for the largest rivers: the Ganges–Brahmaputra, the Changjiang, the Huanghe and, to a lesser extent, the Indus and the Zhujiang. This suggests that present-day average discharge at the outlet has remained constant throughout the Quaternary at least for very large rivers (drainage area of the order of 105–106 km2). This, in turn, suggests either that continental denudation of large Asian catchments has remained on average constant, implying a strong tectonic control on erosion during the Quaternary, or that the river network has the ability to buffer changes in hillslope erosion or in sea-level in order to conserve the total discharge at the outlet. We show how this buffering capacity relies on the characteristic reaction time-scale of Asian alluvial plains (of the order of 105–6 years), that is, much higher than the time-scales of the Quaternary climate oscillations (of the order of 104 years). A short-term perturbation originating in hillslopes will be diluted by the floodplain. At the outlet the signal should have a longer time span and a smaller amplitude. In the same manner, an alluvial plain should not instantaneously react to a 104-year sea-level drop because of its inertia. Along with long-term tectonic control we infer this buffering to be the main cause for the average constancy of sediment yield of large Asian rivers during the Quaternary.},

	abstract = {Fan deltas are excellent recorders of fan-building processes because of their high sedimentation rate, particularly in tectonically active settings. Although previous research focuses mainly on allogenic controls, there is clear evidence for autogenically produced storage and release of sediment by flume and numerical modelling that demands further definition of characteristics and significance of autogenically forced facies and stratigraphy. Analogue experiments were performed on fan deltas with constant extrinsic variables (discharge, sediment supply, sea-level and basin relief) to demonstrate that fan-delta evolution consists of prominent cyclic alternations of channellized flow and sheet flow. The channellized flow is initiated by slope-induced scouring and subsequent headward erosion to form a channel that connected with the valley, while the removed sediment is deposited in a rapidly prograding delta lobe. The resulting decrease in channel gradient causes a reduction in flow strength, mouth-bar formation, flow bifurcation and progressive backfilling of the channel. In the final stage of channel filling, sheet flow coexists for a while with channellized flow (semi-confined flow), although in cycle 1 this phase of semi-confined flow was absent. Subsequent autocyclic incisions are very similar in morphology and gradient. However, they erode deeper into the delta plain and, as a result, take more time to backfill. The duration of the semi-confined flow increases with each subsequent cycle. During the period of sheet flow, the delta plain aggrades up to the ‘critical’ gradient required for the initiation of autocyclic incision. This critical gradient is dependent on the sediment transport capacity, defined by the input conditions. These autogenic cycles of erosion and aggradation confirm earlier findings that storage and release of sediment and associated slope variation play an important role in fan-delta evolution. The erosional surfaces produced by the autocyclic incisions are well-preserved by the backfilling process in the deposits of the fan deltas. These erosional surfaces can easily be misinterpreted as climate, sea-level or tectonically produced bounding surfaces.},

Paleobotanical, paleopedologic, and oxygen isotope studies indicate high temperatures during the PETM and sharp declines in precipitation compared with late Paleocene estimates. Insect and oligochaete burrows increase in abundance during the PETM, suggesting longer periods of soil development and improved drainage conditions. Crayfish burrows and molluscan body fossils, abundant below and above the PETM interval, are significantly less abundant during the PETM, likely because of drier floodplain conditions and lower water tables. Burrow diameters of the most abundant ichnofossils are 30–46\% smaller within the PETM interval. As burrow size is a proxy for body size, significant reductions in burrow diameter suggest that their tracemakers were smaller bodied. Smaller body sizes may have resulted from higher subsurface temperatures, lower soil moisture conditions, or nutritionally deficient vegetation in the high-CO2 atmosphere inferred for the PETM. Smaller soil fauna co-occur with dwarf mammal taxa during the PETM; thus, a common forcing mechanism may have selected for small size in both above- and below-ground terrestrial communities. We predict that soil fauna have already shown reductions in size over the last 150 years of increased atmospheric CO2 and surface temperatures or that they will exhibit this pattern over the next century. We retrodict also that soil fauna across the Permian-Triassic and Triassic-Jurassic boundary events show significant size decreases because of similar forcing mechanisms driven by rapid global warming.},

We examined 5,062 fossil leaves from five sites positioned before, during, and after the PETM (59–55.2 Ma). The amount and diversity of insect damage on angiosperm leaves, as well as the relative abundance of specialized damage, correlate with rising and falling temperature. All reach distinct maxima during the PETM, and every PETM plant species is extensively damaged and colonized by specialized herbivores. Our study suggests that increased insect herbivory is likely to be a net long-term effect of anthropogenic pCO2 increase and warming temperatures.},

Mammal dwarfing has been observed, along with other changes in community structure, during the largest of these ancient global warming events, known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum [PETM; {\textasciitilde}56 million years ago (Ma)]. We show that mammalian dwarfing accompanied the subsequent, smaller-magnitude warming event known as Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 [ETM2 ({\textasciitilde}53 Ma)]. Statistically significant decrease in body size during ETM2 is observed in two of four taxonomic groups analyzed in this study and is most clearly observed in early equids (horses). During ETM2, the best-sampled lineage of equids decreased in size by {\textasciitilde}14\%, as opposed to {\textasciitilde}30\% during the PETM. Thus, dwarfing appears to be a common evolutionary response of some mammals during past global warming events, and the extent of dwarfing seems related to the magnitude of the event.

	abstract = {Study of planktonic foraminiferal assemblages preserved in the central, equatorial Pacific (ODP Site 865) reveal that genera which inhabited the near-surface, mixed layer diversified during the latest Paleocene thermal maximum (LPTM). This transient diversification gave rise to a suite of short-lived (50 to several 100 ka), distinctive morphotypes (Morozovella allisonensis sp. nov., M. africana, and Acarinina sibaiyaensis) that are restricted to the LPTM interval. Parallel morphometric and stable isotopic data have been recorded from individual shells of members of the M. velascoensis/M. allisonensis and A. soldadoensis/A. sibaiyaensis lineages. The single-specimen isotope data confirm that M. allisonensis and A. sibaiyaensis are indeed stratigraphically restricted to the LPTM carbon isotope excursion; all specimens recorded anomalously low δ13C values. A stratigraphic succession of single-specimen isotope data from within the δ13C excursion interval was used to reconstruct the complex population dynamics which mediated the rapid ({\textless}10 ka) evolution of the LPTM taxa. These data reveal that local populations of ancestral M. velascoensis temporarily collapsed with the descendant M. allisonensis suddenly originating from a peripherally isolated population. This pattern is most consistent with peripatric speciation. Overall, the evolutionary transition from Acarinina soldadoensis to A. sibaiyaensis is most consistent with sympatric speciation, although certain elements of this transition are suggestive of a parapatric mechanism. We postulate that the rapid evolution of the LPTM taxa A. sibaiyaensis and M. allisonensis was fostered by a deepening of the nutrient-depleted, mixed layer. Alternatively, the LPTM morphotypes M. allisonensis and A. sibaiyaensis may have been extreme ecophenotypic variants arrayed along an intensified ecological gradient. Support for this latter interpretation is derived from the morphometric data which clearly show the morphological intergradation of the LPTM taxa with their respective ancestors. Thus, the morphologic diversification seen during the LPTM may represent failed speciations. Both scenarios invoke a temporary steepening of clinal gradients in response to intensified oligotrophy. The strong size-dependencies displayed by the δ18O and δ13C signatures of M. allisonensis and A. sibaiyaensis suggest that photosymbiosis facilitated the evolutionary success of the morozovellids and acarininids during the LPTM.},

	abstract = {There is now a large published literature on the strengths and weaknesses of downscaling methods for different climatic variables, in different regions and seasons. However, little attention is given to the choice of downscaling method when examining the impacts of climate change on hydrological systems. This review paper assesses the current downscaling literature, examining new developments in the downscaling field specifically for hydrological impacts. Sections focus on the downscaling concept; new methods; comparative methodological studies; the modelling of extremes; and the application to hydrological impacts. Consideration is then given to new developments in climate scenario construction which may offer the most potential for advancement within the ‘downscaling for hydrological impacts’ community, such as probabilistic modelling, pattern scaling and downscaling of multiple variables and suggests ways that they can be merged with downscaling techniques in a probabilistic climate change scenario framework to assess the uncertainties associated with future projections. Within hydrological impact studies there is still little consideration given to applied research; how the results can be best used to enable stakeholders and managers to make informed, robust decisions on adaptation and mitigation strategies in the face of many uncertainties about the future. It is suggested that there is a need for a move away from comparison studies into the provision of decision-making tools for planning and management that are robust to future uncertainties; with examination and understanding of uncertainties within the modelling system.

	abstract = {In the latest Paleocene an abrupt shift to more negative δ13C values has been documented at numerous marine and terrestrial sites [Bralower et al., 1997; Cramer et al., 1999; Kaiho et al., 1996; Kennett and Stott, 1991; Koch et al., 1992; Stott et al., 1996; Thomas and Shackleton, 1996; Zachos et al., 1993]. This carbon isotope event (CIE) is coincident with oxygen isotope data that indicate warming of surface waters at high latitudes of nearly 4°–6°C [Kennett and Stott, 1991] and more moderate warming in the subtropics [Thomas et al., 1999]. Here we report 187Os/188Os isotope records from the North Atlantic and Indian Oceans which demonstrate a {\textgreater}10\% increase in the 187Os/188Os ratio of seawater coincident with the late Paleocene CIE. This excursion to higher 187Os/188Os ratios is consistent with a global increase in weathering rates. The inference of increased chemical weathering during this interval of unusual warmth is significant because it provides empirical evidence supporting the operation of a feedback between chemical weathering rates and warm global climate, which acts to stabilize Earth's climate [Walker et al., 1981]. Estimates of the duration of late Paleocene CIE [Bains et al., 1999; Bralower et al., 1997; Norris and Röhl, 1999; Röhl et al., 2000] in conjunction with the Os isotope data imply that intensified chemical weathering in response to warm, humid climates can occur on timescales of 104–105 years. This interpretation requires that the late Paleocene thermal maximum Os isotope excursion be produced mainly by increased Os flux to the ocean rather than a transient excursion to higher 187Os/188Os ratios in river runoff. Although we argue that the former is more likely than the latter, we cannot rule out significant changes in the 187Os/188Os ratio of rivers.},

	abstract = {The tectonic relations between foreland and hinterland deformation in noncollisional orogens are critical to understanding the overall development of orogens. The classic central Cordilleran foreland fold-and-thrust belt in the United States (Late Jurassic to early Tertiary Sevier belt) and the more internal zones to the west (central Nevada thrust belt) provide data critical to understanding the development of internal and external parts of orogens. The Garden Valley thrust system, part of the central Nevada thrust belt, crops out in south-central Nevada within a region generally considered to be the hinterland of the Jurassic to Eocene Sevier thrust belt. The thrust system consists of at least four principal thrust plates composed of strata as young as Pennsylvanian in age that are unconformably overlain by rocks as old as Oligocene, suggesting that contraction occurred between those times. New U/Pb dates on intrusions that postdate contraction, combined with new paleomagnetic data showing significant tilting of one area prior to intrusion, suggest that regionally these thrusts were active before ∼85–100 Ma. The thrust faults are characterized by long, relatively steeply dipping ramps and associated folds that are broad and open to close, upright and overturned. Although now fragmented by Cenozoic crustal extension, individual thrusts can be correlated from range to range for tens to hundreds of kilometers along strike. We correlate the structurally lowest thrust of the Garden Valley thrust system, the Golden Gate-Mount Irish thrust, southward with the Gass Peak thrust of southern Nevada. This correlation carries the following regional implications. At least some of the slip across Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous foreland thrusts in southern Nevada continues northward along the central Nevada thrust belt rather than northeastward into Utah. This continuation is consistent with age relations, which indicate that thrusts in the type Sevier belt in central Utah are synchronous with or younger than the youngest thrusts in southern Nevada. This in turn implies that geometrically similar Sevier belt thrusts in Utah must die out southward before they reach Nevada, that slip along the southern Nevada thrusts is partitioned between central Nevada and Utah thrusts, or that the Utah thrusts persist into southeastern Nevada but are located east of the longitude of the central Nevada thrust belt. As a result of overall cratonward migration of thrusting, the central Nevada thrust belt probably formed the Cordilleran foreland fold-thrust belt early in the shortening event but later lay in the hinterland of the Sevier fold-thrust belt of Idaho-Wyoming-Utah.},

For example, in 1992 Hurricane Andrew caused over \$20 billion (in 2002 U.S. dollars) in insured losses, the largest loss on record due to a natural disaster. In addition, 26 of the top 30 insured losses were produced by extreme weather events, mainly landfalling hurricanes and typhoons and European windstorms. A better understanding of how extreme events vary with climate would benefit the reinsurance industry and society. The Risk Prediction Initiative hosted a workshop on Weather Extremes and Atmospheric Oscillations that examined how extreme meteorological events of interest to the reinsurance industry are influenced by the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), the Arctic Oscillation (AO), and the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO). Workshop participants concluded that the stratosphere is much more relevant to predictions that aid the reinsurance industry than is generally recognized and that there is mutual interest in fostering research on the relationship between the stratospheric circulation and extreme weather events. A preliminary science–business research agenda, based on presentations and discussions during and after the workshop, highlights four areas of mutual interest to scientists and insurers. The research areas focus mainly on understanding how the QBO, AO, and MJO influence the frequency and intensity of extreme events, with particular emphasis on tropical cyclones and European windstorms. An awareness of how the catastrophe reinsurance industry operates provides insights into why specific research areas were chosen. For example, the reinsurance industry operates on the basis of annual contracts, most of which are renewed on 1 January. Thus, although skillful forecasts at any lead are of interest, skillful forecasts of extreme events are of greatest value when made in the final quarter of a calendar year.},

	abstract = {There is a direct influence of global warming on precipitation. Increased heating leads to greater evaporation and thus surface drying, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of drought. However, the water holding capacity of air increases by about 7\% per 1°C warming, which leads to increased water vapor in the atmosphere. Hence, storms, whether individual thunderstorms, extratropical rain or snow storms, or tropical cyclones, supplied with increased moisture, produce more intense precipitation events. Such events are observed to be widely occurring, even where total precipitation is decreasing: ‘it never rains but it pours!’ This increases the risk of flooding. The atmospheric and surface energy budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle, and also in the slower rate of change that occurs in total precipitation than total column water vapor. With modest changes in winds, patterns of precipitation do not change much, but result in dry areas becoming drier (generally throughout the subtropics) and wet areas becoming wetter, especially in the mid- to high latitudes: the ‘rich get richer and the poor get poorer’. This pattern is simulated by climate models and is projected to continue into the future. Because, with warming, more precipitation occurs as rain instead of snow and snow melts earlier, there is increased runoff and risk of flooding in early spring, but increased risk of drought in summer, especially over continental areas. However, with more precipitation per unit of upward motion in the atmosphere, i.e. ‘more bang for the buck’, atmospheric circulation weakens, causing monsoons to falter. In the tropics and subtropics, precipitation patterns are dominated by shifts as sea surface temperatures change, with El Niño a good example. The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to an unprecedented drop in land precipitation and runoff, and to widespread drought, as precipitation shifted from land to oceans and evaporation faltered, providing lessons for possible geoengineering. Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely and too often, and with insufficient intensity, resulting in recycling that is too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short, which affects runoff and soil moisture.},

A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response, as estimated in slab ocean responses to the doubling of CO2, and not in transient climate change scenarios. All of these robust responses are consequences of the increase in lower-tropospheric water vapor.},

To compensate for the warm tropospheric temperature, atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) moisture must increase to maintain positive convective available potential energy (CAPE) in convective regions. In nonconvective regions, ABL moisture is controlled by different balances and does not increase as much, creating a spatial gradient of ABL moisture anomalies. Associated with this spatial pattern of the ABL moisture anomalies are two main mechanisms responsible for the anomalous tropical precipitation. In the “upped-ante mechanism,” increases in ABL moisture are opposed by imported dry air wherever inflow from nonconvective regions over margins of convective regions occurs. The ABL moisture is not enough to meet the higher “convective ante” induced by the warmer tropospheric temperature, so precipitation is decreased. In the “anomalous gross moist stability mechanism,” gross moist stability is reduced due to increased ABL moisture. As a result, convection is enhanced and precipitation becomes heavier over convective regions. While the upped-ante mechanism induces negative precipitation anomalies over the margins of convective regions, the anomalous gross moist stability mechanism induces positive precipitation anomalies within convective regions. The importance of variation in gross moist stability, which is likely to differ among climate models, is suggested as a potential factor causing discrepancies in the predicted regional tropical precipitation changes.},

	abstract = {Complexity and resolution of global climate models are steadily increasing, yet the uncertainty of their projections remains large, particularly for precipitation. Given the impacts precipitation changes have on ecosystems, there is a need to reduce projection uncertainty by assessing the performance of climate models. A common way of evaluating models is to consider global maps of errors against observations for a range of variables. However, depending on the purpose, feature-based metrics defined on a regional scale and for one variable may be more suitable to identify the most accurate models. We compare three different ways of ranking the CMIP3 climate models: errors in a broad range of climate variables, errors in global field of precipitation, and regional features of modeled precipitation in areas where pronounced future changes are expected. The same analysis is performed for temperature to identify potential differences between variables. The multimodel mean is found to outperform all single models in the global field-based rankings but performs only averagely for the feature-based ranking. Selecting the best models for each metric reduces the absolute spread in projections. If anomalies are considered, the model spread is reduced in a few regions, while the uncertainty can be increased in others. We also demonstrate that the common attribution of a lack of model agreement in precipitation projections to different model physics may be misleading. Agreement is similarly poor within different ensemble members of the same model, indicating that the lack of robust trends can be attributed partly to a low signal-to-noise ratio.},

A new generation of more complex models running scenarios for the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) is widely, and perhaps naively, expected to provide more detailed and more certain projections. Here we show that projected global temperature change from the new models is remarkably similar to that from those used in IPCC AR4 after accounting for the different underlying scenarios. The spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation change are also very consistent. Interestingly, the local model spread has not changed much despite substantial model development and a massive increase in computational capacity. Part of this model spread is irreducible owing to internal variability in the climate system, yet there is also uncertainty from model differences that can potentially be eliminated. We argue that defining progress in climate modelling in terms of narrowing uncertainties is too limited. Models improve, representing more processes in greater detail. This implies greater confidence in their projections, but convergence may remain slow. The uncertainties should not stop decisions being made.},

	abstract = {Experimentally determined shoreline migration rates show high-frequency autogenic variability superimposed on low-frequency allogenic shoreline responses induced by eustatic base level change. This variability persists even when the shoreline migration is averaged laterally, indicating time variation in total sediment discharge reaching the shoreline. The magnitude of autogenic variability in shoreline migration rate changes by roughly a factor of 3 depending on the shoreline migration direction: It is strongest during transgression, when the shoreline is on average migrating against the mean sediment flow, and weakest during regression, when the shoreline is migrating with the mean sediment flow. We propose that this time variation is due to overall sediment storage and release in the fluvial system. We use a one-dimensional geometric model to model the autogenic signals observed in the experiment. The model uses small periodic changes in the fluvial slope to represent the effects of storage and release of supplied sediment due to intrinsic variation in the transport efficiency of the fluvial system. The periodic pulses of sediment discharge to the shoreline required in the model to explain the variations in shoreline migration can exceed by an order of magnitude the mean allogenic sediment discharge. The slope variability required in the model to explain the autogenic shoreline signals is 1–4\% of the mean slope. This is well within the range of observed variability in depositional fluvial slopes. We propose that at least part of this observed variability is real; that is, the long-profile slope of a depositional river system may have an intrinsic “elasticity” of a few percent of its mean value, even under steady forcing. Autogenic slope variation of this magnitude could readily produce parasequence-scale deposits in the stratigraphic record.},

	abstract = {Methods for estimating palaeoslope from fluvial deposits have been available for some time, but new data and improved understanding of the relevant physical processes afford the possibility of improving existing methods, and the emerging field of quantitative stratigraphy provides a new context for the results. Here we focus on deriving palaeoslope estimates for coarse-grained fluvial deposits. These estimates can be used in basin analyses to constrain the magnitude of the slope change necessary for a given deflection of palaeocurrents, to constrain temporal and spatial variation in basin subsidence rate, and to provide a surface datum for use in sediment-backstripping calculations. The algorithm we derive to estimate palaeoslope applies to rivers that self-adjust through variations in channel width to maintain a temporally and spatially averaged bed shear stress equal to some constant multiple of the critical shear stress for initial motion of bed sediment. Data from modern coarse-grained rivers with minimal bank cohesion and form resistance suggest that this boundary shear stress is equal to about 1.4 times the critical shear stress for movement of the median-sized clast of the surface layer. The key sedimentological criteria for recognition of systems appropriate for this type of analysis are: (1) field relations suggesting that channel banks formed in effectively noncohesive gravel (i.e. free of clay-size sediment and plant roots); (2) absence of significant volumes of dune-derived cross-stratification; and (3) absence of indicators of extremely rapid, flash-flood-type deposition. The basic input data for a palaeoslope calculation are spatially averaged estimates of palaeodepth and median grain size. The most important aspect of data collection is that the depth and grain-size estimates should be determined independently by random sampling over the whole outcrop. Joint analysis of data from appropriate modern rivers and of errors associated with palaeodepth and grain-size estimates indicates that in coarse-grained braided-river deposits, palaeoslope can be estimated to within a factor of 2.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Laboratory-scale experiments of erosion have demonstrated that landscapes have a natural (or intrinsic) response time to a change in precipitation rate. In the last few decades there has been growth in the development of numerical models that attempt to capture landscape evolution over long timescales. However, there is still an uncertainty regarding the validity of the basic assumptions of mass transport that are made in deriving these models. In this contribution we therefore return to a principal assumption of sediment transport within the mass balance for surface processes; we explore the sensitivity of the classic end-member landscape evolution models and the sediment fluxes they produce to a change in precipitation rates. One end-member model takes the mathematical form of a kinetic wave equation and is known as the stream power model, in which sediment is assumed to be transported immediately out of the model domain. The second end-member model is the transport model and it takes the form of a diffusion equation, assuming that the sediment flux is a function of the water flux and slope. We find that both of these end-member models have a response time that has a proportionality to the precipitation rate that follows a negative power law. However, for the stream power model the exponent on the water flux term must be less than one, and for the transport model the exponent must be greater than one, in order to match the observed concavity of natural systems. This difference in exponent means that the transport model generally responds more rapidly to an increase in precipitation rates, on the order of 10$^{\textrm{5}}$ years for post-perturbation sediment fluxes to return to within 50{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% of their initial values, for theoretical landscapes with a scale of 100×100{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}km. Additionally from the same starting conditions, the amplitude of the sediment flux perturbation in the transport model is greater, with much larger sensitivity to catchment size. An important finding is that both models respond more quickly to a wetting event than a drying event, and we argue that this asymmetry in response time has significant implications for depositional stratigraphies. Finally, we evaluate the extent to which these constraints on response times and sediment fluxes from simple models help us understand the geological record of landscape response to rapid environmental changes in the past, such as the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM). In the Spanish Pyrenees, for instance, a relatively rapid (10 to 50{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}kyr) duration of the deposition of gravel is observed for a climatic shift that is thought to be towards increased precipitation rates. We suggest that the rapid response observed is more easily explained through a diffusive transport model because (1) the model has a faster response time, which is consistent with the documented stratigraphic data, (2) there is a high-amplitude spike in sediment flux, and (3) the assumption of instantaneous transport is difficult to justify for the transport of large grain sizes as an alluvial bedload. Consequently, while these end-member models do not reproduce all the complexity of processes seen in real landscapes, we argue that variations in long-term erosional dynamics within source catchments can fundamentally control when, how, and where sedimentary archives can record past environmental change.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we examine the sediments, flora, and fauna from an expanded section at Mattawoman Creek-Billingsley Road (MCBR) in Maryland and explore the impact of warming at a nearshore shallow marine (30–100 m water depth) site in the Salisbury Embayment. Observations indicate that at the onset of the PETM, the site abruptly shifted from an open marine to prodelta setting with increased terrestrial and fresh water input. Changes in microfossil biota suggest stratification of the water column and low-oxygen bottom water conditions in the earliest Eocene. Formation of authigenic carbonate through microbial diagenesis produced an unusually large bulk carbon isotope shift, while the magnitude of the corresponding signal from benthic foraminifera is similar to that at other marine sites. This proves that the landward increase in the magnitude of the carbon isotope excursion measured in bulk sediment is not due to a near instantaneous release of 12C-enriched CO2. We conclude that the MCBR site records nearshore marine response to global climate change that can be used as an analog for modern coastal response to global warming.},

	abstract = {Abstract Tectonics and climate are the major extrinsic upstream controls on both the external and internal architectures of fluvial channels. While the role of tectonics has been well-documented, the role of climate has received less attention. Because both tectonics and climate can produce similar stratigraphic architectures the ability to recognize and differentiate these has major ramifications for the interpretation of fluvial stratigraphy. The Pennsylvanian to Permian succession of the Maritimes Basin complex on Cape Breton Island is ca 5 km thick, and is composed of predominantly non-marine strata deposited within a series of depocentres characterized by different subsidence regimes. Basins in the west are transtensional depocentres characterized by episodic fault movement. In contrast, basins in the east were formed during prolonged periods of passive thermal subsidence. The stratigraphy is composed of four second order sequences (A to D), each 5 to 10 m.y. in duration. These sequences are composed of amalgamated fluvial channel deposits that fine upwards into extensive mud-dominated floodplain deposits with isolated fluvial channel bodies. A spectrum of fluvial styles is recorded within the study area including perennial, perennial/intermittent and ephemeral. Four stratigraphic intervals (E1 to E4) are recognized in which the deposits of strongly seasonal perennial/intermittent fluvial deposits are predominant. These intervals, 2 to 6 m.y. in duration, are correlated across the study area between basins with differing tectonic regimes and do not correlate with a particular position in second order sequences. This suggests that climate exerted the dominant influence on the formation of these intervals and can be differentiated from tectonic imprints. While the tectonic regime of a particular basin exerted a fundamental control on the external architecture, a coherent record of climate change is recognized in the internal architecture of fluvial units. This study demonstrates that tectonic and climatic controls can be recognized and differentiated in vertical successions by evaluating changes in fluvial architecture.

The aim of this study was to obtain new insight into the depositional dynamics and resultant stratigraphy of steep, high-energy dryland rivers in particular. The study site is within the Luni River, the largest river in the Thar Desert, India. A 700 m wide section, 5 m deep, was logged and the dated-stratification related to the flow regimen. Seasonal discharges may reach 14 000 m3 sec?1 but the bed is usually dry. The deposits consist mainly of sandy upper-stage plane bed lamination and low-angle stratification deposited in supercritical flows with some strata showing gravel-lense antidune signatures. Estimated hydraulic parameters indicate a dominance of the upper-stage plane bed state. Less frequent dune trough cross-sets occur at all depths, yet commonly as isolated sets with erosive upper boundaries. Localized deep scour causes slumping and soft-sediment deformation. Scour holes adjacent to older bedded deposits are rapidly infilled, often by massive deposits. Repeated deep scour results in units of deposition of different ages (50 to 500 a bp) and different facies found at similar shallow depths (2 to 3 m). Older dates (1 to 2 ka bp) occur in lower strata (4 to 5 m depths) at which depths younger units also are preserved locally. The steep, high-energy depositional environment promotes the unusual preservation and predominance of upper-stage facies, in contrast to a relative paucity of lower-stage facies. Frequent local deep-scour during floods means that specific facies rarely can be traced across the river channel for more than a few metres, but are replaced by other facies in close proximity. These results should help interpretation of high-energy sediment deposits widely and improve understanding of the stratigraphic development in modern dryland rivers, and in characterizing oil, gas and groundwater reservoirs in the dryland geological record more generally.},

We used field measurements and historical analysis of air photos and topographic maps to identify geomorphic trends of the lower White River, Arkansas, USA, in the 70years following base-level lowering at its confluence with the Mississippi River and concurrent with flood control by dams. Incision was identified below a knickpoint area upstream of St. Charles, AR, and increases over the lowermost {\textasciitilde}90km of the study site to {\textasciitilde}2m near the confluence with the Mississippi River. Mean bankfull width increased by 30m (21\%) from 1930 to 2010. Bank widening appears to be the result of flow regulation above the incision knickpoint and concomitant with incision below the knickpoint. Hydraulic modeling indicated that geomorphic adjustments likely reduced flooding by 58\% during frequent floods in the incised, lowermost floodplain affected by backwater flooding from the Mississippi River and by 22\% above the knickpoint area. Dominance of backwater flooding in the incised reach indicates that incision is more important than flood control on the lower White River in altering flooding and also suggests that the Mississippi River may be the dominant control in shaping the lower floodplain. Overall, results highlight the complex geomorphic adjustment in large river-floodplain systems in response to anthropogenic modifications and their implications, including reduced river-floodplain connectivity.},

On long timescales, channels migrate via avulsion, the process of channel bed deposition and abandonment that often results in catastrophic flooding and loss of life on densely populated fans. We present results of an experimental fan that creates realistic channel patterns by avulsion. The avulsion cycle occurs with a period that is predictable from conservation of mass. Selection of a new flow path is inherently stochastic; however, once a network of 4–5 channels is established, flow oscillates among these channels indefinitely. We demonstrate that a directed random walk model with memory quantitatively reproduces these dynamics and limiting behavior, and is consistent with natural fans.},

	abstract = {Channel migration is a major determinant of vegetation patterns in the tower bottomlands of the southeastern-coastal plain of the United States. Lateral channel movement creates new surfaces by point-bar deposition and the filling in of abandoned channels. The new surfaces are rapidly colonized by flood-tolerant, opportunistic species. Sediment deposited during subsequent years’ flooding raises young surfaces, making them less susceptible to inundation and more suitable for the establishment of less flood-tolerant species that eventually replace the early arrivals. The continued presence of the young forest communities depends primarily on the formation of new surfaces by channel migration and the development of shallow swamps. Shallow swamps are formed when channel obstructions force water into the adjacent bottomlands, destroying forest stands and allowing the establishment of early successional species. Many of the streams in the southeastern coastal plain have been channelized. Stabilized channels limit the development of shallow swamps and preclude the formation of point bars and oxbow lakes. Therefore, the largest-scale natural disturbance mechanism and the most important factor controlling spatial heterogeneity in the lower bottomland sites has been eliminated. Channelization will likely result in a shift towards a homogeneous floodplain forest composed of later successional mesic species that occupied the outer floodplain before channelization.},

	abstract = {This paper describes and interprets the floodplain stratigraphy of two low-energy rivers in the East Midlands, U.K. and goes on to present an appropriate model of floodplain evolution that may be applicable to other lowland rivers in temperate mid-latitudes. Work has been undertaken at the reach level to try and characterize the entire system. In general only laterally extensive exposures have been used, and detailed stratigraphic and microstratigraphic recording has been used to facilitate process interpretations. All the sites have been radiocarbon dated. The dataset consists of three sites in the Soar valley and five sites in the larger Nene valley. The most common sedimentary architecture is a basal gravel with occasional shallow channels, covered by a mixed loam (sand-silt-clay) of variable thickness with landsurfaces and evidence of bioturbation. This loam is frequently interrupted by palaeochannels, and finally all these sediments are buried by a massive silt-clay unit. Most of the palaeochannels were abandoned in the early Flandrian, or between ca. 3500 years BP and 2000 years BP. The superficial silty clay is diachronous largely because of the irregular topography of the floodplain onto which it was deposited; dates from non-palaeochannel sections range from ca. 3500 BP to ca. 2100 years BP. The floodplain stratigraphy has been profoundly influenced by soil development and sub-aerial processes, especially tree-throw, which has produced distinctive sedimentary structures. The loam unit is interpreted as a soil which developed inbetween both silting palaeochannels and active channels. The landsurfaces are both earlier and contemporaneous with the later phase of channel abandonment. There is some evidence, ca. 5000-4000 BP, of a rise in floodplain watertables. An evolutionary model is proposed which can account for the stratigraphic evidence reported here. It is based upon the development of an anastomosing (stable multiple-channel) system from an initial braided-river topography and its eventual conversion to a predominantly single-channel system due to floodplain and channel siltation. The reduction of channels is compensated for by a change in channel types and capacities while the floodplain aggrades; this is the stable-bed aggrading-banks (SBAB) model, which necessitates no changes in discharges. It is suggested that the sub-meandering or straight to sinuous nature of many lowland U.K. channels may be due to their evolution from an anastomosing pattern where the least meandering channels survived typically with a box-S shape planform and at the edges of the floodplain. The sites also show that the Lateglacial fluvial history of the two catchments seems to have been very different, with incision and subsequent aggradation occurring during the Younger Dryas in the Nene but not in the Soar. Given the proximity and similarity of the two catchments this suggests that relatively minor local factors may have been able to push some catchments across fluvial thresholds. In contrast the Flandrian history of the two rivers has been broadly similar, although there is evidence of greater lateral instability and floodplain reworking in the Soar which may be due to hydrogeological factors or a different landuse history. This work strongly suggests that new process-based interpretations of floodplain stratigraphy, and new models of floodplain evolution may be required before alluvial history can be easily related to the changing Lateglacial and Flandrian climate of lowland U.K.},

This conflict can be avoided through long-term planning efforts which use process-based geomorphic simulation modeling to forecast potential long-term ({\textgreater}50 years) landscape-level effects of water management decisions on river meander migration. We describe two management conflicts from the Sacramento River, California, USA, and analyze alternative management scenarios using results from a meander migration and cutoff simulation model. The first example shows that the existing rock revetment upstream from Woodson Bridge State Recreation Area alters the river meandering and causes erosion problems. Removing the revetment would relocate the channel and create a natural meander-neck chute cutoff, reducing erosion at the park while providing ecosystem benefits. The second example suggests that although a bank revetment is needed to prevent the river from moving away from a major water pump, removing an upstream bank revetment would provide habitat benefits without causing pump facility problems. These examples demonstrate the benefits of taking a long-term, landscape-level view when implementing infrastructure projects in dynamic landscapes.},

Over this period fluvial activity has been characterized by alternating phases of river-bed incision and stability coinciding with non-random, decadal-scale fluctuations in flood frequency and hydroclimate that appear to be linked to changes in large-scale upper atmospheric circulation patterns. Episodes of widespread channel bed incision (1760–1799, 1875–1894, 1955–1969) result from a higher frequency of large floods ({\textgreater} 20 year return period) and cool, wet climate under meridional circulation regimes. Phases of more moderate floods (5–20 year return period), corresponding to zonal circulation types (1820–1874, 1920–1954), are characterized by enhanced lateral reworking and sediment transfer in upper reaches of the catchment, and channel narrowing and infilling downstream. Rates of fluvial activity are reduced in intermediate periods (1800–1819, 1895–1919) with no dominant circulation regime associated with lower flood frequency and magnitude. The results of this study provide a valuable guide for forecasting probable drainage basin and channel response to future climate change.},

	abstract = {Floodplain deposits are recognized as potentially large sinks for fluvial sediments, yet spatial and temporal patterns of accumulation are not known for many river systems. In the tectonically active Bengal Basin, the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers coalesce and have formed a large floodplain/delta complex, where widespread overbank flooding may deposit a significant portion of the river's estimated sediment discharge. To investigate the magnitude and distribution of this process, accumulation rates were determined by 137Cs and 210Pb radioisotope geochronology at 60 sites located in three regions of the Bengal Basin differing in age, physiography, and river influence. These geochronological methods have been applied to floodplain environments in only a few recent studies, and the present research offers a revised approach for heterogeneous systems. Patterns of sediment deposition in the Bengal Basin reveal three dominant controls on floodplain accretion: channel processes, overbank flooding, and surface runoff. Accretion is most rapid in the river braidbelt and adjacent floodplain, decreasing rapidly with distance from the main channel. Accumulation rates increase again in low-lying distal basins, where several meters of annual precipitation and associated runoff rework surrounding floodplain surfaces and transport remobilized sediments to local catchments. The extent and magnitude of this process indicate its comparable importance with overbank deposition for floodplain accumulation. A sediment budget for the study area reveals that at least 15\% of the estimated 1 billion tonnes of fluvial sediment discharge is stored annually and not reaching the oceans as previously assumed. Extrapolated to the remaining ∼60,000 km2 of floodplain not covered in this project, the sequestered load could rise to {\textgreater}30\% of annual sediment discharge.},

	abstract = {Floodplains along the braided gravel-bed Waimakariri River are discontinuous although generally extensive landforms composed predominantly of gravel bars capped with vertically accreted fines. In order of importance, three mechanisms lead to floodplain formation. River bed abandonment by lateral migration of the braid-train initiates the formation of the largest floodpiains, which usually occur downstream of tributary fans and valley bedrock spurs. In the headwater reaches, localized river bed aggradation during high magnitude events leads to floodplain formation by producing a surface resistant to erosion by lesser events due to either the coarse nature of the deposit, or by its elevation over the river bed, or both. The least important mechanism initiating floodplain development is localized river or channel incision. A six stage model is proposed for the sequential development of floodplains on the Waimakariri River from: (i) active river bed; (ii) stabilizing bar; (iii) incipient floodplain; (iv) established floodplain; (v) mature floodplain; and to (vi) terrace. Two mechanisms, lateral migration by the braid-train and reactivation of abandoned channels within floodplains, operating separately or in combination, are responsible for floodplain reworking and their relatively young age ({\textless}250 years). Clearly, braided rivers can construct substantial areas of well developed floodplain.},

	abstract = {In this study, geomorphological, sedimentological, and geochronological work was conducted on unconfined and confined reaches of three rivers in the eastern interior of South Africa in order to quantify the relative rates of floodplain reworking and alluvial preservation along river courses with variable valley confinement and lithology. Using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating techniques, new chronologies for the Schoonspruit and Mooi River were created and the existing Klip River chronology was expanded. The results suggest that floodplains in both unconfined and confined reaches preserve complex spatial and temporal patterns of alluviation, although differences in boundary conditions lead to variation in the processes and rates of floodplain construction and reworking. On the Klip and Mooi Rivers where local base levels are stable, channels in unconfined reaches rework floodplain sediments through slow lateral migration punctuated by local erosion during avulsion events. On the Schoonspruit where base level has lowered, the channel in the unconfined reach is incised, the floodplain is abandoned, and a large gully has formed. In the confined reaches of all three rivers, the narrow floodplains are reworked by scour and fill activity and limited lateral migration. The OSL results suggest that unconfined reaches preserve relatively continuous alluvial records that extend into the Pleistocene, while the floodplains in the confined reaches preserve relatively discontinuous alluvial records biased toward the late Holocene. The alluvial geochronologic records in these systems preserve signals of changes in local base level controlled by variation in lithology and incision rather than climate change. By defining the processes, rates, and patterns of floodplain reworking in reaches with different degrees of valley confinement and channel incision, the findings contribute to understanding how rivers build, modify, and preserve alluvial sedimentary archives.},

	abstract = {Problems are often encountered in accurately establishing the rates of processes associated with river channel change. In this study, optical dating was used to obtain the lateral migration rate of an abandoned meander bend on the Klip River, eastern Free State, South Africa. Five samples were collected by augering along a transect across an approximately 200-m-wide scroll-bar sequence on the inner meander bend, and an additional sample was collected from the channel fill of the related oxbow lake. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages were derived for each sample using the single-aliquot regenerative-dose protocol on small aliquots of quartz. Incomplete bleaching was evident in some of the samples and thus the appropriate statistical analysis was performed using the ‘finite mixture model’ for the scroll-bar samples and the ‘minimum age model’ for the channel-fill sample. The ages calculated were in the correct chronological order for the depositional sequence, which was formed over the last ∼1000 years. The average rate of lateral migration across the scroll-bar sequence was found to be ∼0.16 m/yr but with an apparent increase in the rate occurring during the early sixteenth century. Where quartz-rich alluvium exists, the methods used in this study can potentially be applied to other river systems, enabling rates of channel change processes to be determined.},

	abstract = {Human occupation and development of alluvial river floodplains are adversely affected by river channel lateral migration, which may range as high as several hundred metres per year. Reservoirs that reduce the frequency and duration of high flows typically reduce lateral migration rates by factors of 3 to 6. The ecology of riverine corridors is dependent upon the processes of erosion and sedimentation, which lead to lateral migration. Multiple-objective use of floodplains adjacent to active rivers therefore requires tools for assessing the probability and magnitude of channel movements. Existing approaches for predicting river channel movement may be classified as empirical or mechanistic, and are inadequate for widespread application. The Missouri River downstream from Fort Peck Dam in Montana, a major alluvial river with flow highly perturbed by regulation, was selected for case study. Maps and aerial photographs were available before and after dam construction. This imagery was analysed by digitizing channel centrelines at successive coverages under pre-dam and post-dam conditions, and mean migration rates were computed by bend and by reach. The mean rate of channel centreline migration fell from 6.6 m yr-1 to 1.8 m yr-1 after impoundment. Bend-mean channel activity rates were only weakly correlated with variables describing channel form and geometry. Results indicate that flow regulation for flood control and hydropower production typical of the study reach had profound effects on river corridor dynamism, with implications for habitat type distribution and ecosystem integrity.},

In more detail, the internal evolution in a drainage basin after a climatic event results in a delayed response of the morphology and sedimentation pattern.

It is concluded that the relation between fluvial development and climate is not a simple one, but is fundamentally dependant on the timescale.},

	abstract = {Many large rivers flow through a variety of geologic materials. Within the span of several kilometres, bends may alternately flow against recently reworked sediments, older, more indurated sediments or highly resistant materials. As sediment size, cementation, and other properties strongly influence the erodibility of river banks, erosion rates and channel planform are likely to vary significantly along the length of large rivers. In order to assess the role of bank materials on bank erosion rates, we develop a method for detecting relative differences in erodibility between bank materials along large floodplains. By coupling historic patterns of channel change with a simple model of bank erodibility we are able to track relative changes in bank erodibility among time intervals and bank materials. We apply our analysis to the upper Willamette River, in northwestern Oregon for three time periods: 1850–1895, 1895–1932 and 1972–1995 and compute relative differences in bank erodibility for Holocene alluvium, partially cemented Pleistocene gravels, and revetments constructed in the 20th century. Although the Willamette is fundamentally an anastomosing river, we apply the model to single-thread portions of the channel that evolved through lateral migration. Our simple model of bank erodibility reveals that for all three-time periods, banks composed of Holocene alluvium are at least 2–5 times more erodible than banks composed of Pleistocene gravels. Revetment installed in the 20th century is highly resistant to erosion and is at least 10 times less erodible than Pleistocene gravels. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

While forcing-response mechanisms of small catchments are reasonably well understood, the response of larger drainage basins is less clear. In particular, the impact of land use and climate change on the Rhine system is poorly understood because of the catchment size (185 000 km2) and the long history of human cultivation, which started approximately 7500 years ago. A sediment budget is calculated to specify the amount of alluvial sediment that was deposited during the Holocene and to estimate long-term soil erosion rates. The results suggest that 59±14 X 109 t of Holocene alluvial sediment is stored in the non-alpine part of the Rhine catchment (South and Central Germany, Eastern France, The Netherlands). About 50\% of Holocene alluvial sediment is deposited along the trunk valley and the delta (Upper Rhine, Lower Rhine, coastal plain), while the rest is stored along the tributary valleys. The floodplain sediment storage corresponds to a mean erosion rate of 0.55±0.16 t/ha per yr (38.5±10.7 mm/kyr) across the Rhine catchment outside the Alps. This Holocene-averaged estimate amounts for sediments that were delivered to the channel network and is at the lower limit of erosion rates from other studies of different methodology.},

The Amazon river basin hosts tributaries that are largely unaffected by engineering controls and hold a range of sediment loads, allowing us to explore the influence that sediment supply has on river evolution. Here we calculate average annual rates of meander migration within 20 reaches in the Amazon Basin from Landsat imagery spanning 1985–2013. We find that rivers with high sediment loads experience annual migration rates that are higher than those of rivers with lower sediment loads. Meander cutoff also occurs more frequently along rivers with higher sediment loads. Differences in meander migration and cutoff rates between the study reaches are not explained by differences in channel slope or river discharge. Because faster meander migration and higher cutoff rates lead to increased sediment-storage space in the resulting oxbows, we suggest that sediment supply modulates the reshaping of floodplain environments by meandering rivers. We conclude that imposed sediment loads influence planform changes in lowland rivers across the Amazon.},

Meandering channels can be classified into four types according to the influence of these cohesive deposits: (1) fixed meanders, (2) restricted meanders, (3) confined free meanders, and (4) truly free meanders. Laboratory experiments and field observations of point bars in low gradient sand-bedded meandering rivers have revealed that, unlike in gravel-bedded rivers, point bars develop in response to the pattern of flow through the bends, that is point bars in these rivers are a result rather than a cause of meandering. Point bar platforms, which are the flat tops of point bars, are gradually covered in these rivers by inner bank accretions deposited out of suspension. Therefore, bends with well developed point bar platforms lacking accretion deposits must be in a state of active channel migration and, consequently widening.},

The results show that the morphological changes of the river mouth bar have been closely associated with the largely reduced fluvial discharge and sediment load. Landform development such as bar progradation occurred in two phases, i.e. before and after 1989, which correspond to faster and lower bar growth rates, respectively. Fast riverbed aggradation in the mouth channel was strongly related to river mouth bar progradation. During 1976–1996, about 2.8\% of the total sediment loads were deposited in the river channel on the upper to middle delta. Therefore, the river water level rose by a few meters from 1984 to 1996. The frequent distributary channel migration, which switched the radial channel pattern into the SE-directed pattern in the mid-1980s, was linked with mouth bar formation. Marine conditions also constrain seaward bar progradation. Furthermore, the history of river mouth bar formation reflects human impacts, such as dredging and dyking in order to stabilize the coastal area.},

	abstract = {Piggyback basins developed at the mountain fronts of collisional orogens can act as important, and transient, sediment stores along major river systems. It is not clear, however, how the storage and release of sediment in piggyback basins affects the sediment flux and evolution of downstream river reaches. Here, we investigate the timing and volumes of sediment storage and release in the Dehra Dun, a piggyback basin developed along the Himalayan mountain front in northwestern India. Based on OSL dating, we show evidence for three major phases of aggradation in the dun, bracketed at ca. 41–33 ka, 34–21 ka and 23–10 ka, each accompanied by progradation of sediment fans into the dun. Each of these phases was followed by backfilling and (apparently) rapid fan-head incision, leading to abandonment of the depositional unit and a basinward shift of the active depocentre. Excavation of dun sediment after the second and third phases of aggradation produced time-averaged sediment discharges that were ca. 1–2\% of the modern suspended-sediment discharges of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers that traverse the margins of the dun; this sediment was derived from catchment areas that together comprise 1.5\% of the drainage area of these rivers. Comparison of the timing of dun storage and release with upstream and downstream records of incision and aggradation in the Ganga show that sediment storage in the dun generally coincides with periods of widespread hinterland aggradation but that late stages of dun aggradation, and especially times of dun sediment excavation, coincide with major periods of sediment export to the Ganga Basin. The dun thus acts to amplify temporal variations in hinterland sediment supply or transport capacity. This conceptual model appears to explain morphological features of other major river systems along the Himalayan front, including the Gandak and Kosi Rivers, and may be important for understanding sediment flux variations in other collisional mountain belts.},

	abstract = {The Rio Grande in the Big Bend region of Texas, USA, and Chihuahua and Coahuila, Mexico, undergoes rapid geomorphic changes as a result of its large sediment supply and variable hydrology; thus, it is a useful natural laboratory to investigate the relative importance of flow strength and sediment supply in controlling alluvial channel change. We analyzed a suite of sediment transport and geomorphic data to determine the cumulative influence of different flood types on changing channel form. In this study, physically based analyses suggest that channel change in the Rio Grande is controlled by both changes in flow strength and sediment supply over different spatial and temporal scales. Channel narrowing is primarily caused by substantial deposition of sediment supplied to the Rio Grande during tributary-sourced flash floods. Tributary floods have large suspended-sediment concentrations, occur for short durations, and attenuate rapidly downstream in the Rio Grande, depositing much of their sediment in downstream reaches. Long-duration floods on the mainstem have the capacity to enlarge the Rio Grande, and these floods, released from upstream dams, can either erode or deposit sediment in the Rio Grande depending upon the antecedent in-channel sediment supply and the magnitude and duration of the flood. Geomorphic and sediment transport analyses show that the locations and rates of sand erosion and deposition during long-duration floods are most strongly controlled by spatial changes in flow strength, largely through changes in channel slope. However, spatial differences in the in-channel sediment supply regulate sediment evacuation or accumulation over time in long reaches (greater than a kilometer).},

	abstract = {Wetlands are well known to act as sinks for sediment and chemicals in the landscape. Within the Mkuze River floodplain in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, deposition of clastic sediment occurs predominantly in close proximity to the river channel, resulting in the formation of levees. Over time, this leads to channel avulsion, a process that may be accelerated by the activities of hippopotami whose trails create hydraulically favourable pathways. Sedimentation rates, determined using the isotopes 210Pb and 137Cs, indicate that the Mkuze River floodplain is a relatively rapidly aggrading system that should experience frequent avulsion, with average short-term rates in the order of 0.25 to 0.50cm/y. Sediments on the floodplain are also an important sink for solutes, which concentrate in the groundwater and precipitate out because of evapotranspiration. Over long timescales, chemical sedimentation affects the landscape by influencing salinity, vegetation distribution, hydrological flows, and local topography. The Mkuze River floodplain is an actively evolving system, which continues to aggrade as a result of the combination of clastic and chemical sedimentation. In a region characterised by a strong annual water deficit, temporal patterns of clastic and chemical sedimentation are likely to exert influence on the long-term development of wetland systems elsewhere in southern Africa. This study, the first on sediment accretion rates using 210Pb and 137Cs dating for a southern African wetland, demonstrates that radioisotopic methods are an important tool that can be applied toward fully understanding wetland formation, evolution, and functioning in the region.},

	abstract = {The use of sequence stratigraphic principles as a correlation tool within fluvial depositional systems has been a topic of debate for a long time. Changes in facies stacking patterns caused by allocyclic events are often masked or completely overprinted by autocyclic events and therefore the recognition of correlative time-significant markers can be difficult. These problems are more difficult to solve when trying to apply sequence stratigraphic principles to subsurface well datasets. A method is presented here based on the concepts of accommodation versus sediment supply interactions (A/S) and their variations at a hierarchy of temporal scales. These changes lead to the development of a pattern of overall increasing or decreasing A/S values reflected in the sedimentary record. The key addition to existing ideas about continental fluvial sequence stratigraphy is the notion that the rate of fluvial aggradation through time, as controlled by the accommodation versus sediment supply rate, is dynamic and not static. The use of the concepts of A/S interactions allows for the fluvial stratigraphic system to be analysed not only (or solely) in terms of regional to local base level changes that affect accommodation but as an integrated parameter with regional to local sediment supply changes. A practical definition of base level (or stratigraphic reference level) in fluvial systems is outlined and formulated as the lower boundary of real-time accommodation or upper boundary of net accommodation (lower limit to erosion). In areas not directly affected by laterally migrating fluvial channels or channel belts, the upper boundary of net accommodation at a specific time scale can in some cases be genetically coupled to the most mature palaeosols. In other cases, the upper boundary of net accommodation may be picked at a laterally extensive caliche layer formed at a depth relatively unaffected by short-term erosion and deposition. The method presented here is not meant as a substitute for previous stratigraphic methods or models for fluvial systems but as an alternative to be used as seen appropriate given the type and amount of data available. The application and limitations of this method are highlighted in a case study from the Statfjord Group, Statfjord Field, in the Norwegian North Sea.},

	abstract = {Studies in stratigraphy are often driven by the predicted climate change and possible gains for the oil and gas industry. Because, at present predictions of the development of future deltaic architecture are insufficient. This thesis addresses the problem of qualitative and quantitative understanding of sedimentary systems in two stages. In the first stage the stratigraphy of Holocene delta deposits of the Kura and Mahakam deltas (respectively in Azerbaijan en Indonesia) are studied. Results from these studies provide insights as an analogue to ancient systems and serve as an example for expected future conditions. The results form the Kura delta show a prominent role for the rapid sea-level change of the Caspian Sea, while the results of Mahakam delta suggest an important role for the eustatic Holocene sea-level curve and the absence of floods of the Mahakam River. Information obtained from studies in a similar context have the potential to reduce uncertainties and increase confidence in models. The second stage of this thesis covers the development of a process-response simulation model to assess the impact of changes in sediment supply and sea-level on fluvio-deltaic stratigraphy. Anticipating on the dominant role of sediment supply on fluvial dominated deltas, a choice is made for a detailed investigation in how to incorporate good estimates of sediment supply in the numerical model, that enable to explore the possibilities of using a probabilistic approach instead of a deterministic output or geostatistical analysis.},

The predictions of the model can be calibrated to reproduce the topography of the post-settlement lithosome with an average error of 7\%. The model also correctly predicts the decrease in mean grain size away from the channel. The model greatly underestimates the ability of floodwaters to transport sand away from the channel. Apparently, sand is transported across the floodplain by bedload transport and by advective suspended sediment transport as well as by diffusion. If flow duration data for 1912–1981 and the present rating curve for the Brandywine Creek at Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, are assumed to apply throughout the post-settlement period, the model may be used to estimate palaeohydraulic characteristics of post-settlement floods. Calculations indicate that 212 post-settlement floods covered the floodplain to an average depth of 1.6 m, transported an average excess suspended sediment concentration of 6200 ppm, and deposited an average thickness of 1.4 cm of sediment on levees next to the channel.},

	abstract = {Understanding how environmental forcings (e.g., tectonics, climate) are transformed by erosional landscapes into sedimentary signals is a critical component of inverting the stratigraphic record. Previous research has largely focused on sediment supply (Qs) and grain size as the de facto sedimentary signals of changing forcing mechanisms. We use a numerical model to consider the paired response of sediment provenance (Pv), expressed as fractional sediment load, and Qs to demonstrate that the same change in environmental forcing may have a different expression in the sedimentary record. While Qs reflects integrated denudation across an erosional catchment, Pv is controlled by spatially variable erosion that occurs in transient landscapes. Pv from proximal sediment sources increases during upstream knickpoint migration, whereas Pv from distal sediment sources increases when bedrock channels incise to produce lower gradient profiles. Differences between the Qs and Pv signals relate to distinct geomorphic processes that operate on different time scales and allow for a refined differentiation of the timing and mechanism of forcings than possible via analysis of either signal alone. Future efforts to integrate multiple sedimentary signals may thus yield a richer picture of underlying forcing mechanisms, facilitating efforts to invert the stratigraphic record.},

	abstract = {Extant, planform-based facies models for alluvial deposits are not fully fit for purpose, because they over-emphasise plan form whereas there is little in the alluvial rock record that is distinctive of any particular planform, and because the planform of individual rivers vary in both time and space. Accordingly, existing facies models have limited predictive capability. In this paper, we explore the role of inter-annual peak discharge variability as a possible control on the character of the preserved alluvial record. Data from a suite of modern rivers, for which long-term gauging records are available, and for which there are published descriptions of subsurface sedimentary architecture, are analysed. The selected rivers are categorized according to their variance in peak discharge or the coefficient of variation (CVQp=standard deviation of the annual peak flood discharge over the mean annual peak flood discharge). This parameter ranges over the rivers studied between 0.18 and 1.22, allowing classification of rivers as having very low ({\textless}0.20), low (0.20–0.40), moderate (0.40–0.60), high (0.60–0.90), or very high ({\textgreater}0.90) annual peak discharge variance. Deposits of rivers with very low and low peak discharge variability are dominated by cross-bedding on various scales and preserve macroform bedding structure, allowing the interpretation of bar construction processes. Rivers with moderate values preserve mostly cross-bedding, but records of macroform processes are in places muted and considerably modified by reworking. Rivers with high and very high values of annual peak discharge variability show a wide range of bedding structures commonly including critical and supercritical flow structures, abundant in situ trees and transported large, woody debris, and their deposits contain pedogenically modified mud partings and generally lack macroform structure. Such a facies assemblage is distinctively different from the conventional fluvial style recorded in published facies models but is widely developed both in modern and ancient alluvial deposits. This high-peak-variance style is also distinctive of rivers that are undergoing contraction in discharge over time because of the gradual annexation of the channel belt by the establishment of woody vegetation. We propose that discharge variability, both inter-annual peak variation and “flashiness” may be a more reliable basis for classifying the alluvial rock record than planform, and we provide some examples of three classes of alluvial sediment bodies (representing low, intermediate, and high/very high discharge variability) from the rock record that illustrate this point.},

	abstract = {Oxygen isotopic analyses of pelagic Foraminifera from Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific deep-sea cores indicate that the temperature of superficial waters in the equatorial Atlantic and Caribbean underwent periodic oscillations during the Pleistocene with an amplitude of about 6° C. The temperature record of the Pacific cores was much affected by local oceanographic conditions. Seven complete temperature cycles are shown by a Caribbean core. By extrapolating rates of sedimentation based on radiocarbon data, an age of about 280,000 years is obtained for the earliest temperature minimum. Correlation with continental events suggests that the earliest temperature minimum corresponds to the first major glaciation. The chronology of Pacific cores proposed by Arrhenius (1952) must be modified if correspondence with the chronology of Atlantic and Caribbean cores is desired. In one Pacific core which extends to the Pliocene, the 610-cm. level below top is believed to represent the Plio-Pleistocene boundary. About fifteen complete temperature cycles occur above this level, and the length of Pleistocene time is estimated at about 600,000 years. The so-called pre-Günzian stages appear to span a time interval about as long as the Giinz and post-Giinzian stages. A glacial lowering of sea-level of about 100 m. is indicated. Closely spaced samples from short pilot cores furnish a detailed temperature record for postglacial times. A continuous temperature increase from about 16,500 to about 6,000 years ago is indicated, followed by a small temperature decrease. The temperature maximum at about 6,000 years ago is correlated with the "Climatic Optimum." Isotopic analyses of calcareous benthonic Foraminifera show that the temperature of bottom water in the equatorial Pacific during glacial ages was similar to the present, but in the eastern equatorial Atlantic it was about 2.1° C. lower. This difference resulted from the large amount of marine ice present in the North Atlantic. Interglacial bottom temperature in the equatorial Pacific was not more than about 0.8° C. higher than glacial temperatures; interglacial data for the equatorial Atlantic are inconclusive with respect to temperature but indicate an influx of ice meltwater along the bottom larger than at present. Correspondence in time between temperature variations in the low latitudes, as shown by the cores, and glacial events in the high northern latitudes indicates close correspondence between glacial or interglacial phases and wet or dry phases, respectively. Good correlation exists between times of temperature minima as indicated by extrapolated rates of sedimentation and times of insolation minima in high northern latitudes. Control of world climate during the Pleistocene by insolation in the high northern latitudes is indicated. A retardation of about 5,000 years occurred between temperature and insolation cycles. Complete revision of current correlations between the insolation curve and continental events is necessary. The glacial epoch and its ages may be explained by a theory combining topographical and insolation effects. Conditions may be suitable for the beginning of a new ice age in about 10,000 years.},

Data is far less available when addressing the sensitivity of common geomorphological metrics, such as channel steepness, to climatic boundary conditions. We test the relationship between channel steepness and precipitation rate by measuring a large number of channels in different mountainous areas. These regions exhibit a tenfold variation in precipitation rate between them ({\textasciitilde}100–1000mmy−1) but have similar uplift rates, allowing the tectonic variable to be controlled. By accounting for the orographic coupling of rainfall with uplifted topography, we find that channel steepness is significantly suppressed by higher precipitation rates in a measurable way that conforms to simple stream power erosion laws and empirical constraints on their parameters. We demonstrate this using modern and estimated glacial precipitation rates; and climate emerges as an important, quantifiable control on channel geometry. These findings help to explain why highly variable measurements of channel steepness are reported from different locations and provide important empirical constraints on how climate shapes tectonically active landscapes.},

	abstract = {It has become increasingly difficult to assess the impact of changes in the sediment flux to the coastal zone because of the conflicting impacts of humans. Globally, soil erosion is accelerating (e.g., deforestation, some agriculture practices), while at the same time sediment flux to the coastal zone is globally decelerating (e.g., water diversion schemes, dams). Reduced loads delivered to the coastal zone result in an accelerated coastal erosion and a decrease in habitat. The reduction of the seasonal flood waves also means that sediment is dispersed over smaller areas of the continental margin. One of the great challenges facing hydrologists, with regard to our understanding of anthropogenic versus climate-change impacts on the hydrological cycle, is the quality and duration coverage of hydrological data, particularly on pristine rivers. For many rivers, the length of hydrological coverage is measured in years rather than decades, with no rivers with reliable observations across centuries. In other words, if a river's discharge is monitored during periods where the impacts of humans or nature produce a long-term trend, then the return-interval concept for floods and droughts, for instance, becomes meaningless. In addition, river systems are conditioned by events that are largely prehistorical. Forensic studies of paleoriver systems provide us with some ability to assess and discern the impacts of humans versus climate.},

Hence, these architectural characteristics alone do not permit the definition of accommodation-based “systems tracts” and “settings”, and this calls into question current sequence stratigraphic practice in application to fluvial successions.},

	abstract = {Kaolinite usually is present in relatively small amounts in most upper Paleocene and lower Eocene neritic deposits of the northern US Atlantic Coastal Plain. However, there is a short period (less than 200,000k.y.) in the latest Paleocene (upper part of calcareous nannoplankton Zone NP 9) when kaolinite-dominated clay mineral suites replaced the usual illite/smectite-dominated suites. During this time of global biotic and lithologic changes, kaolinite increased from less than 5\% of the clay mineral suite to peak proportions of 50–60\% of the suite and then returned to less than 5\% in uppermost Paleocene/lowermost Eocene strata. This kaolinite pulse is present at numerous localities from southern Virginia to New Jersey. These sites represent both inner and middle neritic depositional environments and reflect input from several river drainage systems. Thus, it is inferred that kaolinite-rich source areas were widespread in the northeastern US during the latest Paleocene. Erosion of these source areas contributed the kaolinite that was transported and widely dispersed into shelf environments of the Salisbury embayment. The kaolinite increase, which occurred during a time of relatively high sea level, probably is the result of intensified weathering due to increased temperature and precipitation. The southern extent of the kaolinite pulse is uncertain in that uppermost Paleocene beds have not been identified in the southern Atlantic Coastal Plain. The late Paleocene kaolinite pulse that consists of an increase to peak kaolinite levels followed by a decrease can be used for detailed correlation between more upbasin and more downbasin sections in the Salisbury embayment. Correlations show that more upbasin Paleocene/Eocene boundary sections are erosionally truncated. They have varying portions of the kaolinite increase and, if present at all, discontinuous portions of the subsequent kaolinite decrease. As these truncated sections are disconformably overlain by lower Eocene strata, rapid erosional removal of large parts of the most kaolinite-rich P/E boundary clay deposits occurred by early Eocene time. Erosion of the kaolinite-rich P/E boundary beds was enhanced during times of sea-level fall when kaolinite-rich sediments were redeposited to produce kaolinite spikes in basal beds of lower and middle Eocene sequences that have little or no kaolinite elsewhere in the sequence. In contrast, more downbasin sites document only the upper, decreasing part of the kaolinite pulse. The absence of strata documenting the earlier kaolinite increase is attributed to slow sedimentation (condensed interval) as a result of a significant sea level rise that ponded most sediments in shallower waters, combined with the probable subsequent erosional removal of these thin downbasin deposits by oceanic currents.},

	abstract = {Fluvial levees are elevated partitions between channels and floodplains. Because of their character and position, levees may provide critical controls on, and insights into, geomorphic processes that determine the distribution of water and sediment within river systems. Few studies have analysed the character, distribution, sedimentology and processes that form levees in modern depositional environments. Characterisation of levee deposits from the Mississippi River continues to form the basis for most levee interpretations from the rock record. This discussion paper assesses the reliability of interpretations of levee deposits in numerous examples from the rock record, and their associated inferences for river style. This uncertainty reflects the lack of definitive sedimentological attributes for levee deposits, their limited preservation potential, and the fact that levee identification in the rock record is inhibited by the reliance on geometric descriptors or indirect associations between channel and floodplain facies. Given these concerns, it is suggested that geomorphologists and sedimentologists need to recognise the limitations of our present knowledge of levees, and work towards a more systematic understanding of these significant fluvial landforms in the full spectrum of modern (and ancient) river settings.},

Avulsions are primarily features of aggrading floodplains. Their recurrence interval varies widely among the few modern rivers for which such data exist, ranging from as low as 28 years for the Kosi River (India) to up to 1400 years for the Mississippi. Avulsions cause loss of life, property damage, destabilization of shipping and irrigation channels, and even coastal erosion as sediment is temporarily sequestered on the floodplain. They are also the main process that builds alluvial stratigraphy. Their causes remain relatively unknown, but stability analyses of bifurcating channels suggest that thresholds in the relative energy slope and Shields parameter of the bifurcating channel system are key factors.},

Remote sensing and field data from the large rivers Missouri, Mississippi, Amazon, Ob'-Irtysh, Taquari, and Altamaha show a variety of water types on inundated floodplains, including areas of mixing of river and local water defined as the ?perirheic zone.? For the rivers examined here, only the Missouri River flooded its entire valley with sediment-rich river water. Therefore the floodplains of these large rivers from the Arctic to the Amazon are only partially inundated with river water during floods and the corresponding perirheic zones may encompass a significant floodplain ecotone.},

In each scenario, the forward motion of initial, highly disorganized dunes generates a signiﬁcant record exclusively containing autogenic signals that arise from early dune growth, deformation, and merging. However, continued dune growth scours deeply, and shreds all records of early dunes. Afterward, dunes self-organize into quasi-stable groups. Forward motion of dune groups creates, truncates, and amalgamates sets and co-sets of cross-strata, quickly forming a second, signiﬁcantly more robust stratigraphic record, which preserves a comingling of signals sourced from ongoing autogenic processes and each scenario’s speciﬁc set of environmental forcings, the allogenic boundary conditions of the sand sea. Although the importance of self-organization on modeled aeolian stratiﬁcation is clear in the few presented scenarios, selforganization may be throttled via variability in environmental forcings, as thoroughly documented in a companion paper (Cardenas et al., this issue). Therefore, additional work is warranted because this numerical experiment only begins to sample possible sets of environmental forcing, boundary conditions, and initial conditions, geomorphic responses, and consequential preservation possible in the presented surface-stratigraphic bedform modeling framework.},

Sedimentology 36, 1–23] of the modern Saskatchewan River system (Cumberland Marshes, central Canada), and serve to characterize avulsion depositional sequences in the ancient Willwood and Fort Union Formations (Paleogene, Bighorn Basin, NW Wyoming, USA). We recognize, however, that the model is not universally applicable to avulsion-dominated successions, specifically systems which lack defining “heterolithic avulsion deposits”, set forth by Kraus and Wells [Kraus, M.J., Wells, T.M., 1999.

Observations in several fluvial intervals suggest that the avulsion stratigraphy outlined by Kraus and Wells [Kraus, M.J., Wells, T.M., 1999. Recognizing avulsion deposits in the ancient stratigraphical record. In: Smith, N.D., Rogers, J. (Eds.), Fluvial Sedimentology VI, Special Publication of the International Association of Sedimentologists, vol. 28, pp. 251–268] represents one category of avulsion stratigraphy found in the rock record, but does not capture the nature of avulsion deposits everywhere. Based on observations (using measured sections, outcrop photo-panels, and aerial photographs) in the Willwood Formation (Eocene, Wyoming) and Ferris Formation (Cretaceous/Paleogene, Wyoming), we present two end-member categories of avulsion stratigraphy in ancient deposits; stratigraphically abrupt, when a main paleochannel is stratigraphically juxtaposed directly atop floodplain/overbank deposits, and stratigraphically transitional, where crevasse splays and other non-floodplain/-overbank deposits stratigraphically precede a main paleochannel. This characterization provides a broader, more inclusive way to recognize and describe avulsion stratigraphy in ancient deposits and may be an important factor to consider when modeling connectivity in fluvial reservoirs. Furthermore, our observations show that one type of avulsion channel stratigraphy may prevail over another within an ancient basin, suggesting that system-wide factors such as splay-proneness or avulsion style (i.e. aggradational, incisional, etc.; [Slingerland, R., Smith, N.D., 2004. River avulsions and their deposits. Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences 32, 257–285]) may be primary controls on the type of avulsion stratigraphy deposited and preserved in ancient basin-fills.},

	abstract = {Detailed investigations of high latitude sequences recently collected by the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) indicate that periods of rapid climate change often culminated in brief transient climates, with more extreme conditions than subsequent long term climates. Two examples of such events have been identified in the Paleogene; the first in latest Paleocene time in the middle of a warming trend that began several million years earlier: the second in earliest Oligocene time near the end of a Middle Eocene to Late Oligocene global cooling trend. Superimposed on the earlier event was a sudden and extreme warming of both high latitude sea surface and deep ocean waters. Imbedded in the latter transition was an abrupt decline in high latitude temperatures and the brief appearance of a full size continental ice-sheet on Antarctica. In both cases the climate extremes were not stable, lasting for less than a few hundred thousand years, indicating a temporary or transient climate state. Geochemical and sedimentological evidence suggest that both Paleogene climate events were accompanied by reorganizations in ocean circulation, and major perturbations in marine productivity and the global carbon cycle. The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum was marked by reduced oceanic turnover and decreases in global  and in marine productivity, while the Early Oligocene glacial maximum was accompanied by intensification of deep ocean circulation and elevated  and productivity. It has been suggested that sudden changes in climate and/or ocean circulation might occur as a result of gradual forcing as certain physical thresholds are exceeded. We investigate the possibility that sudden reorganizations in ocean and/or atmosphere circulation during these abrupt transitions generated short-term positive feedbacks that briefly sustained these transient climatic states.},

	abstract = {CHANGES in the isotope content of the large marine carbon reservoir can force shifts in that of the smaller carbon pools in the atmosphere and on land. The carbon isotope compositions of marine carbonate sediments from the late Palaeocene vary considerably, exhibiting a sudden decrease close to the Palaeocene/Eocene boundary which coincides with deep-sea benthic extinctions1 and with changes in ocean circulation. Here we report that these fluctuations in the marine carbon isotope record are closely tracked by the terrestrial records provided by palaeosol carbonates and mammalian tooth enamel. In using palaeosol carbonates to reconstruct the CO2 content of the ancient atmosphere2, isotope shifts of this sort will have to be taken into account. The sharp decrease in 13C/12C ratios in the late Palaeocene provides a datum for precise correlation of marine and continental records, and suggests that abrupt climate warming at this time may have played an important role in the evolution of land mammals.},

A triangular diagram is used to define eight rock types (orthoquartzite, arkose, graywacke, and five transitional types) based on the mineralogy of the silt-sand-gravel fraction and ignoring clay content. The writer contends that the current practice of calling all clayey sandstones "graywackes" is not valid, inasmuch as it represents a confusion of texture with composition. It is suggested that sedimentary rocks may be best defined by the use of a tripartite name, based on the following pattern-(grain size): (textural maturity) (mineral composition).},

	abstract = {The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) is one of the best known examples of a transient climate perturbation, associated with a brief, but intense, interval of global warming and a massive perturbation of the global carbon cycle from injection of isotopically light carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system. One key to quantifying the mass of carbon released, identifying the source(s), and understanding the ultimate fate of this carbon is to develop high-resolution age models. Two independent strategies have been employed, cycle stratigraphy and analysis of extraterrestrial helium (HeET), both of which were first tested on Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 690. These two methods are in agreement for the onset of the PETM and initial recovery, or the clay layer (“main body”), but seem to differ in the final recovery phase of the event above the clay layer, where the carbonate contents rise and carbon isotope values return toward background values. Here we present a state-of-the-art age model for the PETM derived from a new orbital chronology developed with cycle stratigraphic records from sites drilled during ODP Leg 208 (Walvis Ridge, Southeastern Atlantic) integrated with published records from Site 690 (Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean, ODP Leg 113). During Leg 208, five Paleocene-Eocene (P-E) boundary sections (Sites 1262 to 1267) were recovered in multiple holes over a depth transect of more than 2200 m at the Walvis Ridge, yielding the first stratigraphically complete P-E deep-sea sequence with moderate to relatively high sedimentation rates (1 to 3 cm/ka, where “a” is years). A detailed chronology was developed with nondestructive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning records on the scale of precession cycles, with a total duration of the PETM now estimated to be ∼170 ka. The revised cycle stratigraphic record confirms original estimates for the duration of the onset and initial recovery but suggests a new duration for the final recovery that is intermediate to the previous estimates by cycle stratigraphy and HeET.},

	abstract = {Global warming is generally expected to increase the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events, which may lead to more intense and frequent river flooding. This work assesses the implications of climate change for future flood hazard in Europe. Regional climate simulations from the HIRHAM model with 12-km horizontal resolution were used to drive the hydrological model LISFLOOD, and extreme value techniques were applied to the results to estimate the probability of extreme discharges. It was found that by the end of this century under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 emissions scenario in many European rivers extreme discharge levels may increase in magnitude and frequency. In several rivers, most notably in the west and parts of eastern Europe, the return period of what is currently a 100-year flood may in the future decrease to 50 years or less. A considerable decrease in flood hazard was found in the northeast, where warmer winters and a shorter snow season reduce the magnitude of the spring snowmelt peak. Also in other rivers in central and southern Europe a decrease in extreme river flows was simulated. The results were compared with those obtained with two HIRHAM experiments at 50-km resolution for the SRES A2 and B2 scenarios. Disagreements between the various model experiments indicate that the effect of the horizontal resolution of the regional climate model is comparable in magnitude to the greenhouse gas scenario. Also, the choice of extreme value distribution to estimate discharge extremes influences the results, especially for events with higher return periods.},

Repeated transect measurements of braided channels, formed at several different combinations of slope and discharge, show that, despite large temporal and spatial fluctuations, mean active channel width and depth show an orderly relationship equivalent to the classical downstream hydraulic geometry. Similarly, for a given particle-size distribution, braiding intensity increases with increasing discharge and total stream power, as predicted from theory. Temporal fluctuations in channel form parameters correlate with periodic pulses in bed load over a time scale of hours in the models (probably equivalent to days or weeks in prototype streams). The pulses are generated internally by local degradation and aggradation. Increasing bed-load input to a stream reach causes local aggradation, increased braiding intensity and an increase in the number of migrating, avalanche-face, unit bars. These groups of migrating bars are the primary means of downstream transfer of bed-load pulses. Transfer tends to occur as a downstream progression from one aggradational area (complex bar) to another, through an intervening confluence zone. This provides the framework of longer-term braided stream mechanics within which detailed, reach-scale investigations of short-term channel changes and bar development can be conducted.},

Specifically, we explore the role of sediment cohesion on the scales of autogenic shoreline transgressions and regressions. Results indicate that sediment cohesion enhances the time and space scales associated with autogenic cycles of channel formation, elongation, and abandonment. In systems with high sediment cohesion, this cycle can drive shoreline transgressions that produce flooding surfaces in the resulting stratigraphy which could be confused with surfaces produced by increases in sea level rise or subsidence rates. Enhanced channelization resulting from sediment cohesion also increases the pumping of fine-grained sediment into the marine realm, where it can bypass the delta foreset, thus decreasing total delta sediment retention rate.},

Although measurement error and compaction contribute to these regressions, they are primarily the consequence of unsteady, discontinuous sedimentation. The essential character of the unsteadiness may be cyclic or random, but net accumulation is characterized by fluctuations whose magnitudes increase with increasing recurrence interval.

The completeness of a stratigraphical section is the fraction of time intervals of some specified length (t) that have left a record. A record is left when some sediment is deposited during the interval and is not subsequently eroded. A complete section contains no hiatuses longer than t. The completeness of a section varies with t and its accumulation rate varies with the length of the time span over which it is measured. Plots of measured accumulation rate against time span are an empirical means of estimating completeness. Simple theoretical models help extrapolate meagre data and identify bias.
Completeness at time scale t can depend upon three general properties of the accumulation history: the age of the section, the long term net accumulation rate (drift) and the unsteadiness of the sedimentation rate. The way unsteadiness is measured depends upon the kinds of fluctuations that can be recognized in the accumulation rate. To describe random fluctuations a standard deviation of rates is sufficient. One dimensional Brownian motion is a model of random fluctuations that explains many aspects of stratigraphical completeness. Regular periodic fluctuations in accumulation rate may be described in terms of wavelength and amplitude. Completeness is an increasing function of t, drift and, in the periodic case, the wavelength of fluctuations; it decreases with increasing standard deviation of accumulation rate and the amplitude of periodic fluctuations. The completeness and thickness of stratigraphical sections are weakly positively associated.

	abstract = {Continental shelves and coastal plains are large persistent depositional landforms, which are stationary (nonmigrating) at their proximal ends and characterized by relatively steady long-term growth. In detail, however, their surface form and stratigraphic record is built of transient freely migrating landscape elements. We derive the timescales of crossover from transient to persistent topographic forms using empirical scaling relations for mean sediment accumulation as a function of averaging time, based upon tens of thousands of empirical measurements. A stochastic (noisy) diffusion model with drift predicts all the gross features of the empirical data. It satisfies first-order goals of describing both the surface morphology and stratigraphic completeness of depositional systems. The model crossover from noise-dominated to drift-dominated behavior corresponds to the empirical crossover from transport-dominated (autogenic) transient behavior to accommodation-dominated (subsidence) persistent behavior, which begins at timescales of 102?103 years and is complete by scales of 104?105 years. Because the same long-term scaling behavior emerges for off-shelf environments, it is not entirely explicable by steady subsidence. Fluctuations in sediment supply and routing probably have significant influence. At short-term (transient) scales, the exponents of the scaling relations vary with environment, particularly the prevalence of channeled sediment transport. At very small scales, modeling sediment transport as a diffusive process is inappropriate. Our results indicate that some of the timescales of interest for climate interpretation may fall within the transitional interval where neither accommodation nor transport processes are negligible and deconvolution is most challenging.},

	abstract = {Rivers and canals with perimeters composed of non-cohesive sand and silt have self-formed active beds and banks. They thus provide a most interesting fluid flow problem, for which one must determine the container as well as the flow. If bed load alone occurs across the perimeter of a wide channel, gravity will pull particles down the lateral slope of the banks; bank erosion is accomplished and the channel widens. In order to maintain equilibrium, this export of material from the banks must be countered by an import of sediment from the channel centre.
            The mechanism postulated for this import is lateral diffusion of suspended sediment, which overloads the flow near the banks and causes deposition. The model is formulated analytically with the aid of a series of approximate but reasonable assumptions. Singular perturbation techniques are used to define the channel geometry and obtain rational regime relations for straight channels. A comparison with data lends credence to the model.
            It is hoped that a first step has been made towards a more general treatment, which would include various complicating factors that are important features of natural rivers but are not essential to the maintenance of channel width. Among these factors are meandering, sediment sorting and seepage.},

The analyses of equally spaced cross sections, hypsographic curves and point elevations revealed the significance of the distance from the river bank, the floodplain width and the floodplain flow situation (inflow/outflow sections) for the spatial variability of sediment deposition. Deposition was high near the banks (natural levee formation), in wide floodplain sections and in inflow areas. The overall pattern was modified by the presence of side-channels and the micro-relief of the floodplain. From the derived sedimentation rates (averaged for the past 120years over the reach) of about 11.0mmyr−1 at the natural levee and about 0.3mmyr−1 at the flood protection dyke, we can estimate an overbank deposit rate of 416,000m3yr−1 for the entire free-flowing reach (between river-km 1921 and 1880), that is, between 18 and 20\% of the annual transported suspended load. An analysis of historical cross sections showed that there was no natural levee along the riverbanks shortly after the regulation, about 100years ago. We thus assume that natural levee formation is a consequence of the Danube regulation in the late 19th century. Under natural conditions overbank deposition was balanced and limited by side erosion and lateral channel migration. After stabilization of the banks the overbank deposits were not eroded, and distinct ‘natural’ levees formed. These levees will develop and grow further and affect flood protection and floodplain ecology. We discuss the interplay between floodplain deposition and lateral bank migration under the concept of dynamic equilibrium.},

	abstract = {We present a simple modeling framework for the codetermination of bankfull discharge and corresponding bankfull channel geometry (width, depth, and longitudinal channel slope) of an alluvial meandering river. We specifically consider a sand-bed river whose floodplain is capped by a mud-rich layer. We inquire as to how the wide spectrum of flows to which the river is subjected leads to the establishment of specific values for bankfull discharge and associated bankfull geometry. Here we provide a physically based predictor of bankfull discharge that goes beyond the simple assumption of the 1.5-year flood discharge. We do this using physics-based submodels for channel and floodplain processes. We show that bankfull discharge and bankfull geometry are established as a result of (i) floodplain vertical accretion due to overbank deposition, (ii) migration of the inner bank and outer cut bank, (iii) net removal of floodplain sediment and reduction in average floodplain height due to lateral channel shift, and (iv) in-channel downstream bed material transport. The flow duration curve is employed to quantify the effect of these processes, as well as to account for flow variability. Our model captures the spatiotemporal evolution of bankfull discharge, depth, width, and down-channel slope toward equilibrium for specified flow duration curve and watershed characteristics. Our new framework can be used for assessing long-term river response to change in sediment supply or flow duration curve. A model implementation is presented for the case of the Trinity River, TX, USA, to demonstrate the use of the model and its behavior.},

	abstract = {Equilibrium is defined as a single-valued, temporally invariant functional relationship between the values of an output variable and the values of the input variable(s) in a geomorphic system. Disequilibrium occurs if the output deviates from the functional relationship by more than a consensual degree. Natural geomorphic variables are characterized by a relaxation time. Output variables are insensitive to cyclical inputs with frequencies much greater than the relaxation time, but can respond completely for sufficiently low frequencies. Rapid trends, recent step changes or pulse inputs, and intermediate frequency inputs can cause disequilibrium. The gradient of sand-bed alluvial channels (the output variable) is determined by sediment and water delivery from slopes (the input variables), and changes in this hydraulic regime require regrading by erosion and deposition. Initial stages of adjustment to changed regime in a long, unbranched channel with sediment and water delivery only at the upstream end propagate downstream, but later stages of adjustment occur simultaneously throughout the reach. In a dendritic channel network the gradient responds rather uniformly throughout the network to changes in regime during all stages of adjustment. The time scale of adjustment to changed regime depends upon the size of the channel network (or stream length), the sediment and water discharges, and to a lesser degree upon the magnitude of the change. Grade as defined by Mackin (1948) is synonymous with equilibrium as used in this paper if ‘a period of years’ is replaced by ‘a time period commensurate with the relaxation time of the gradient’. The use of the term grade is best restricted to a single-valued relationship between channel gradient and the hydraulic regime.},

This paper relates channel geometry to measures of streamflow variability as distinct from mean discharge or flow magnitude. A relationship between mean channel width and the mean and coefficient of variation of channel-forming discharges is derived. For the given mean discharge it is shown that the more variable the flow, the narrower the Channel is in the mean. To a great extent, this relationship is confirmed by data on alluvial channels in the Missouri River basin. Variability of water discharges proves to be an important factor influencing natural river geometry. This initial approach to the understanding of the dynamics of river geometry leads to the construction of a simple simulation model in which a series of channel forming discharges is generated and corresponding changing channel geometry is calculated. Results from the simulation indicate (1) the channel has, in effect, a kind of truncated memory; i.e., the impact of an existing channel exists so long as the prevailing discharge does not exceed the present channel capacity; (2) the effect of memory or the impact of the existing channel on the mean channel geometry is opposite to that of flow variability (i.e., the memory tends to keep the channel geometry larger in the mean); (3) the simulated channel width, as expected, increases abruptly at high discharges, declining over time along a die-away curve until the advent of a recorded high flow.},

	abstract = {When the water discharge, sediment supply, and base level vary around stable values, an alluvial river evolves toward a mean equilibrium or graded state with small fluctuations around this mean state (i.e., a dynamic or statistical equilibrium state). Here we present analytical relations describing the mean equilibrium geometry of an alluvial river under variable flow by linking channel slope, width, and bed surface texture. The solution holds in river normal flow zones (or outside both the hydrograph boundary layer and the backwater zone) and accounts for grain size selective transport and particle abrasion. We consider the variable flow rate as a series of continuously changing yet steady water discharges (here termed an alternating steady discharge). The analysis also provides a solution to the channel-forming water discharge, which is here defined as the steady water discharge that, given the mean sediment supply, provides the same equilibrium channel slope as the natural long-term hydrograph. The channel-forming water discharge for the gravel load is larger than the one associated with the sand load. The analysis illustrates how the load is distributed over the range of water discharge in the river normal flow zone, which we term the “normal flow load distribution”. The fact that the distribution of the (imposed) sediment supply spatially adapts to this normal flow load distribution is the origin of the hydrograph boundary layer. The results quantify the findings by Wolman and Miller (1960) regarding the relevance of both magnitude and frequency of the flow rate with respect to channel geometry.},

	abstract = {Erosion from the banks of meandering rivers causes a local influx of sediment to the river channel. Most of the eroded volume is usually replaced in nearby point bars. However, the typical geometry of river bends precludes the local replacement of all eroded material because (i) point bars tend to be built to a lower elevation than cutbanks and (ii) point bars tend to be shorter than the eroding portion of cutbanks because of channel curvature. In a floodplain that is in equilibrium (i.e., neither increasing nor decreasing in volume), sediment eroded from cut banks must be replaced elsewhere on the floodplain. The local imbalance caused by differences in bank height should be balanced primarily by overbank deposition, while the local imbalance caused by curvature should be balanced primarily by deposition in abandoned stream courses or oxbow lakes. Estimates of these local imbalances based on remotely sensed measurements of bank geometry and channel migration have been made on four systems in the United States: a 91-km reach of the Pearl River in Louisiana and Mississippi, a 62-km reach of the Bogue Chitto River in Louisiana, a 35-km reach of the Neuse River in North Carolina, and a 2.7-km reach of the Vermillion River in Minnesota. For these systems, the total local imbalance, integrated over many bends, ranged from 0.36 to 2.27 m3/yr/m of valley length (0.15 to 1.32 m3/yr/m of channel length), or 7 to 45\% of gross cutbank erosion, with a typical value of about 17\%. When compared with gauged suspended sediment data, the measurements provide estimates of the relative importance of floodplains for storing material transported by a river system. The data suggest that even if the studied systems are near long-term mass balance equilibrium (as opposed to undergoing net deposition or erosion), almost all of the sand and in some cases much of the silt and clay in transit through these systems is likely to have spent some time stored in an upstream floodplain.},

	abstract = {A theory for the evolution of a river floodplain and the associated movement of tracer sediment is applied to the case of the upper Clark Fork River, Montana, whose floodplain is contaminated with tailings derived from historical mining activities. Deposition of mine tailings raised the elevation of the floodplain, which now contributes contaminated sediment to the channel. The theory is capable of reproducing the basic aspects of the system's evolution, including aggradation of the floodplain during the mining era and subsequent net supply of sediment from floodplain to channel after the cessation of mine input. Results indicate that the natural removal of tailings from the floodplain could take thousands of years, a period longer than is required for the channel to simply rework the tailings. The self-stabilizing nature of the model results in an evolution toward a new postmine steady state, with tailings eventually almost entirely removed from the system.},

	abstract = {A theory for the movement of suspendible sediment through the floodplain of a simple actively migrating river is developed. The floodplain is represented as a series of sediment storage reservoirs, each incorporating multiple bends of a river. Independent models for floodplain sediment deposition and for subsequent removal of sediment by lateral channel migration allow the volume of sediment stored in the floodplain (and the associated average floodplain elevation) to change over time and down the valley. At a given quasi-steady discharge, deposition depends on a simple one-dimensional partition between channel and floodplain discharge and on suspended sediment concentration (one size class) which varies along the reach depending on lateral supply and floodplain history. Sediment supply is specified at the upstream end of the reach using a suspended sediment rating curve. Long-term average overbank deposition rates are approximated by weighting multiple steady state solutions using a flow duration curve. The channel bed elevation of the system is assumed to be fixed, and tributaries are handled using simple lateral source terms. The interaction between the submodels is such that under constant boundary conditions, the channel evolves toward a state of geomorphic equilibrium where the volume of sediment added to the floodplain by overbank deposition just balances the volume removed by channel migration. The model is easily adapted to track conservative suspended sediment tracer material concentration as such material moves through the channel/floodplain system.},

	abstract = {The spatial heterogeneity of hydrology and vegetation during high-water periods in geomorphically distinct reaches of the Amazon River in Brazil was determined based on semivariance statistics. The spatial statistics were derived from three classified Landsat Thematic Mapper images representing upstream to downstream geomorphic characteristics. In the upstream river reach, scroll-bar topography on the floodplain tends to channelize floodwater into floodplain drainage channels, thus reducing the diversity of water types by reducing opportunities for mixing of flooding river water with locally derived floodplain water. The highest diversity of vegetation types is along floodplain drainage channels, while the rest of the floodplain has a more homogeneous cover. In the middle reach of the river the diversity of wetland classes as measured by semivariance is higher than both upstream and downstream, perhaps because of exposure to more water types and landforms. The diversity of water types is high, because flooding river water flows onto the floodplain as diffuse, non-channelized overbank flow, as well as through drainage channels. The non-channelized overbank flow readily mixes with locally derived floodplain water. Floodplain landforms available for colonization by vegetation include scroll bars, swales, lake shores, lake deltas, and floodplain drainage channels. In the downstream reach where the floodplain is wide, relatively flat, and covered with huge lakes, the floodplain supports a moderately heterogeneous mix of vegetation communities. Where landforms are similar, the spatial distribution of the vegetation is similar to that of the middle reach of the river. In the downstream reach flooded forest comprised only 37\% of the wetland vegetation. In contrast, in both the upstream and middle reaches, over 70\% of the wetland vegetation was flooded forest. Agricultural clearing of the floodplain is more. common in downstream reaches and may account for the smaller percent of floodplain forest cover.},

	abstract = {Results from physical and numerical experiments suggest that sediment cohesion influences deltaic morphodynamics by promoting the development and maintenance of channels. As a result, cohesion is thought to increase the magnitude and time scales of internally generated (autogenic) processes and the dimensions of their stratigraphic products. We test these hypotheses by examining the surface processes and stratigraphic products from a suite of physical experiments where the influence of cohesion is isolated over temporal and spatial scales important for basin filling. Given the stochastic nature of autogenic sediment transport processes, we develop and employ a range of statistical tools and metrics. We observe that (1) an increase in sediment cohesion decreases lateral channel mobility and thus increases the time necessary to regrade deltaic surfaces; (2) enhanced channelization, due to sediment cohesion, increases the time necessary for the deposits of autogenic processes to average together and produce stratigraphic products with shapes set by the generation of regional accommodation; (3) cohesion promotes the transport of suspended sediment to terrestrial overbank and marine environments, which decreases the volume of channel, relative to overbank and marine deposits in the stratigraphic record. This increase in overbank and marine deposition changes the spatial distribution of sand in stratigraphy, with higher cohesion linked to enhanced segregation of fine particles from coarse sand in the experimental deposits. Combined, these results illustrate how the cohesion of sediment is fundamental in setting autogenic spatial and temporal scales and needs to be considered when inverting stratigraphic architecture for paleo-environmental history.},

	abstract = {Here we describe new techniques for creating river-dominated (birds foot) deltas with strong channelization in the laboratory. The key to achieving strong self-channelization is the addition of a commercially available polymer to the sediment mixture. This polymer enhances the substrate strength increasing the critical erosion stress, an important geomorphic threshold. More importantly it increases the rate of cohesion onset to account for increased rates of morphodynamic evolution in small-scale experiments. A cyclic pattern of delta evolution is observed. The delta “avulsion cycle” begins with channel avulsion, erosion, and channel elongation and ends with channel backfilling and abandonment. This cycle appears to be universal but is subject to a range of controls, including sediment size distribution, sediment concentration, substrate cohesiveness, and Froude number. We propose that the observed depositional cycle is characteristic of an avulsion mechanism that is more complex than current models of fluvial systems, which generally explain avulsion probability as an upstream effect dependent on channel superelevation or levee slope. The experiments suggest that in many distributary channel systems, including deltas, alluvial, and deep water fans, downstream mediated topographic effects or “morphodynamic backwater effects” may dominate over upstream avulsion processes and control the surface mechanics and stratigraphy. The experimental observations are synthesized into a new depositional model for river-dominated deltas which emphasizes the importance of self-organization and feedback in delta surface evolution and stratigraphy.},

	abstract = {Natural levees are common features of alluvial river systems, yet their origin and evolution are poorly understood. In this paper, we present morphologic and sedimentologic data from two anastomosed rivers and offer a hypothesis of natural levee growth in these systems based on mechanisms of sediment transport. In settings where floodbasins fill at the same rate as the channel, levees form by turbulent diffusion of suspended sediment away from a high-velocity thread into a floodbasin of relatively stagnant water. The theory of diffusive transport suggests that these levees should be narrow, steep, and display abrupt decreases in grain size due to rapid decreases in carrying capacity with distance into the floodbasin. In environments where an appreciable water surface slope is maintained between the main channel and the floodbasin, levees form by advection of sediment out of the channel and into the floodbasin. Advective transport theory indicates that these levees should be broad and gently sloped, with grain sizes gradually decreasing away from the main channel. Natural levees occurring in the anastomosed reach of the upper Columbia River in SE British Columbia display significantly different morphology from levees in the Cumberland Marshes region of the lower Saskatchewan River in east-central Saskatchewan. At the upper Columbia site, the rise in stage of the floodbasin water nearly keeps up with that of the channel water because of good communication between channel and floodbasins through crevasses. This inhibits the establishment of a water surface slope, and the bulk of the escaping sediment is deposited close to the channel. In contrast, the Cumberland Marshes region is characterized by wide and volumetrically large floodbasins. These conditions keep floodbasin water surface elevations relatively low and maintain an appreciable elevation head between the channel and its floodbasin, fostering levee growth by advective transport.},

	abstract = {Laboratory observations regarding the limit conditions for particle entrainment into suspension are presented. A high-speed video system was used to investigate conditions for the entrainment of sediment particles and glass beads lying over a smooth boundary as well as over a rough bed. The results extend experimental conditions of previous studies towards finer particle sizes. A criterion for the limit of entrainment into suspension is proposed which is a function of the ratio between the flow shear velocity and particle settling velocity. Observations indicate that particles totally immersed within the viscous sublayer can be entrained into suspension by the flow, which contradicts the conclusions of previous researchers. A theoretical analysis of the entrainment process within the viscous sublayer, based on force–balance considerations, is used to show that this phenomenon is related to turbulent flow events of high instantaneous values of the Reynolds stress, in agreement with previous observations. In the case of experiments with a rough bed, a hiding effect was observed, which tends to preclude the entrainment of particles finer than the roughness elements. This implies that, as the ratio between particle and roughness element sizes becomes smaller, progressively higher bed shear stresses are required to entrain particles into suspension. On the other hand, an overexposure effect was also observed, which indicates that a particle moving on a smooth bed is more prone to be entrained than the same particle moving on a bed formed by identical particles.},

	abstract = {Levees are commonly found along every kind of river system, yet there are no widely accepted models for where along the channel they form and what controls their shape. In this study, we investigated whether levee growth is driven by sediment transfer from the channel adjacent to the levee or by inundation dynamics in the flood basin. To test these ideas, we conducted empirical analyses and numerical modeling of levees on the fine-grained, meandering Muscatatuck River, IN. Using LiDAR data, we found no statistical relationship between the levee and the adjacent channel planform, which suggests levees are not genetically related to their adjacent channel. On the contrary, modeling experiments of a simplified Muscatatuck River show that levee initiation can be genetically related to the adjacent channel because bed shear stress on the floodplain is low where channel curvature is high. But after levees initiate, the genetic connection to the adjacent channel is obscured because levee shape is modified by inundation dynamics. For instance, tall mature levees are not inundated regularly and instead obstruct floodplain flow, creating flow shadows on the downstream side. Sediment is preferentially deposited in the flow shadow, which moves the location of maximum deposition from the levee crest to the toe. This causes levees to prograde down-valley, which reshapes the levee and genetically disconnects it from the channel. We propose that this morphodynamic mechanism of levee growth is characteristic of fine-grained rivers in narrow floodplains where flood basins can act as conveyance channels that transport sediment down-valley before deposition.},

Controls on their preservation are well documented for bedforms equilibrated with prevailing flows; however, variability in water and sediment discharge results in bedforms that are routinely out of phase with flow conditions—termed bedform disequilibrium. Using theory and experiments of dune evolution in steady and unsteady flows, we show that preservation of cross strata is greater during unsteady flows—particularly during flood recession—when bedform disequilibrium is prevalent. The enhanced preservation of disequilibrium dynamics is associated with a high bedform preservation ratio, which results from localized increase in sedimentation rates relative to bedform migration rates due to the hierarchical bedform organization during flood recession. We find that the coefficient of variation of cross sets reflects the ratio of the time scales of formative-flood variability and bedform adjustment. We parameterize bedform disequilibrium for rivers globally and suggest that flood variability is a key control on cross set preservation.},

	abstract = {An abrupt global warming event marks the Paleocene–Eocene boundary, known as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). The event is distinguished in the strata globally by a significant negative excursion of δ13C ratio values. The response of the terrestrial biota to the abrupt climatic change has been well studied in northern Wyoming in the Bighorn Basin, where it has been observed that the mammalian fauna during the global warming event is represented by smaller, but morphologically similar species to those found later in the Eocene. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the observation smaller body sizes during the global warming event. In this article, evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that the observed body size decrease during the PETM was influenced by the appearance of smaller southern species who extended their geographic range northward during the abnormal global warming event. Using disperse organic carbon isotopic ratios of bulk sediment, the negative excursion of δ13C was located in the Piceance Creek Basin of western Colorado, 400km to the south of the Bighorn Basin. Below the stratigraphic level marking the negative carbon excursion in the Piceance Creek Basin are five specimens of the phenacodontid mammal (Ectocion parvus), a diminutive species of the genus Ectocion restricted to the basal Eocene (Wa-0 Biozone) in northern Wyoming. The five specimens of E. parvus are associated with a late Paleocene (Clarkforkian) mammalian fauna in Colorado, implying that the diminutive species extended its geographic range northward during the global warming event. This evidence supports biogeographic models that assume poleward biogeographic shifts during global warming events, and will have modern day implications for the conservation of species as global temperatures rise in the near future.},

	abstract = {Climate, tectonics, and life influence the flux and caliber of sediment transported across Earth's surface. These environmental conditions can leave behind imprints in the Earth's sedimentary archive, but signals of climate, tectonic, and biologic change are not always present in the stratigraphic record. Deterministic and stochastic surface dynamics collectively act as a stratigraphic filter, impeding the burial and preservation of environmental signals in sedimentary deposits. Such impediments form a central challenge to accurately reconstructing environmental conditions through Earth's history. Emergent and self-organized length and timescales in landscapes, which are themselves influenced by regional environmental conditions, define spatial and temporal sedimentation patterns in basins and fundamentally control the likelihood of environmental signal preservation in sedimentary deposits. Properly characterizing these scales provides a key avenue for incorporating the known “imperfections” of the stratigraphic record into paleoenvironmental reconstructions. These insights are necessary for answering both basic and applied science questions, including our ability to reconstruct the Earth system response to prior episodes of climate, tectonic, or land cover change.},

Generalized numerical models have shown that the Sadler effect can be recovered, through the action of erosional clipping and time removal (the “stratigraphic filter”), from even fairly simple topographic sequences. However, several lines of evidence suggest that most of the missing time has not been eroded out but rather represents periods of inactivity or stasis. Low temporal completeness could also imply that the stratigraphic record is dominated by rare, extreme events, but paleotransport estimates suggest that this is not generally the case: The stratigraphic record is strangely ordinary. It appears that the organization of the topography into a hierarchy of forms also organizes the deposition into concentrated events that tend to preserve relatively ordinary conditions, albeit for very short intervals. Our understanding of time preservation would benefit from insight about how inactivity is recorded in strata; better ways to constrain localized, short-term rates of deposition; and a new focus on integrated time–space dynamics of deposition and preservation.},

	abstract = {Equilibrium or regime models based on a single formative (channel-forming) discharge have been instrumental in developing a quantitative understanding of river channel dynamics. However, alternative paradigms can be used to ask fundamentally different questions about river channel behavior. In this paper, we present the Stochastic Channel Simulator (STOCHASIM), a simple biogeomorphic model that models the interplay between erosion and vegetation encroachment through changes in channel geometry. Results for a range of flood distributions are compared to predictions from a similar model based upon a traditional regime approach. Flood variability strongly influences the mean channel geometry and channel stability; the regime model and the stochastic model predict the same channel width when flow variability is low but diverge as flow variability increases. The return period of the formative flow required to match the geometry generated by a traditional regime approach increases systematically, from about 2 years for flow regimes in humid regions to nearly 8 years for more variable flow regimes, like those typical of arid regions. While the traditional regime approach provides a reasonable simplification for streams with little variability in the flood distribution, stochastic modeling may provide more realistic estimates of channel size as flood variability increases (e.g., in arid streams or small watersheds). The success of STOCHASIM in replicating realistic patterns of erosion, as well as the historical contingency often observed in natural streams, suggests that adopting a stochastic dynamics paradigm could advance geomorphology, just as it has done in hydrology, ecology, and other natural sciences.},

Preflood versus postflood comparisons were made in three study reaches from well networks established before and reestablished after a major flood. Flood effects were scale dependent and varied with channel constraint and the dominant channel forming process. Large changes were observed in unconstrained stream reaches where channel incision drove large changes in subsurface flow paths and the extent of the hyporheic zone. However, subreach scale differences were apparent. In the lower portion of the studied reach, channel incision lowered the water table, leading to abandonment of secondary channels, and decreased the extent of the hyporheic zone that previously extended more than 30 m into the floodplain. In contrast, the extent of the hyporheic zone increased at the head of the studied reach where channel incision steepened head gradients through a meander bend. In another unconstrained reach, lateral channel jumps dramatically altered exchange flow paths. However, the extensive hyporheic zone was maintained throughout the reach. Less change was observed in the constrained stream reach where both the depth and area of sediment available to be reworked by the flood were limited by bedrock constraining the width of the valley floor. This flood dramatically changed the hyporheic zone at the three study sites and these physical changes are expected to be biologically important, considering the role of the hyporheic zone in stream ecosystem processes.},

We develop a theoretical framework that predicts when a sediment flux signal will be transferred from the landscape to stratigraphy. This threshold magnitude is a function of signal duration. The magnitude is set by the maximum rate of autogenic volume change of the landscape, which decreases with increasing time window. Physical delta experiments, specifically designed to test our theory, demonstrate that only sediment supply signals with a magnitude greater than the threshold are stored in stratigraphy, supporting our theory. This framework allows us to assess the fidelity of the stratigraphic record to archive past signals of environmental change and predict the short- and long-term impact of current anthropogenic forcing on landscapes.},

This study presents experimental results modelling deposition at a river mouth and flow bifurcation around delta islands. Mouth bar formation and channel bifurcation is achieved in a laboratory setting by alternating input of suspended load transport and bedload transport. These two modes of transport produce two characteristic deposits with different advection lengths. Suspended load transport creates a steep deposit far from the inlet, while bedload creates a low angle, levéed deposit near the inlet. This study found that flow bifurcations occur where the proximal and distal deposits encroach on one another; and determined that there is a relationship between the frequency of suspended load transport and the length to channel bifurcation. Frequent flooding causes shorter length to bifurcations, whereas infrequent flooding causes greater length to bifurcations. This work overturns the hitherto understood mechanism of bifurcation location as a function of only high-transport conditions. Instead, the interactions between the sediment transport and deposition from normal flow and large-scale flooding events dictate delta island morphology.},

	abstract = {To simplify the complex hydrological variability of flow conditions, experiments on delta evolution are often conducted using a representative channel-forming flood flow and results are related to field settings using an intermittency factor, defined as the fraction of time in flood. Although this factor provides an approximation of dominant flow conditions and makes modeling deltas easier by turning their complex hydraulics into a single representative value, little is known about how this generalization affects delta processes. We conducted experiments with periodic flow conditions to determine the effects of intermittent discharges on fan deltas. For each run, the magnitude of floods was held constant, but the duration changed, thus varying the intermittency factor, between 1 and 0.2. Floods consisted of higher water and sediment discharge, while base flow periods had lower water discharge and sediment input ceased, causing the system to become erosional during these periods. We find that as the duration of floods decreases, the delta topset is larger in area with a shallower slope due to reworking on the topset during base flow conditions. During base flows, the experimental system adjusts toward a new equilibrium state that in turn acts as the initial condition for subsequent flood periods. These results suggest that the adjustment timescale is a factor in determining the behavior of deltas and their channels. We conclude that both periods of flood when most of the sediment is supplied to the system and periods of base flow when topset sediment is reworked contribute to delta dynamics.},

	abstract = {Erosion and deposition rates estimated from the stratigraphic record frequently exhibit a power-law dependence on measurement interval. This dependence can result from a power-law distribution of stratigraphic hiatuses. By representing the stratigraphic filter as a stochastic process called a reverse ascending ladder, we describe a likely origin of power-law hiatuses, and thus, rate scaling. While power-law hiatuses in certain environments can be a direct result of power-law periods of stasis (no deposition or erosion), they are more generally the result of randomness in surface fluctuations irrespective of mean subsidence or uplift. Autocorrelation in fluctuations can make hiatuses more or less heavy-tailed, but still exhibit power-law characteristics. In addition we show that by passing stratigraphic data backward through the filter, certain statistics of surface kinematics from their formative environments can be inferred.},

	abstract = {The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) is one of the best known examples of a transient climate perturbation, associated with a brief, but intense, interval of global warming and a massive perturbation of the global carbon cycle from injection of isotopically light carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system. One key to quantifying the mass of carbon released, identifying the source(s), and understanding the ultimate fate of this carbon is to develop high-resolution age models. Two independent strategies have been employed, cycle stratigraphy and analysis of extraterrestrial helium (HeET), both of which were first tested on Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 690. These two methods are in agreement for the onset of the PETM and initial recovery, or the clay layer (“main body”), but seem to differ in the final recovery phase of the event above the clay layer, where the carbonate contents rise and carbon isotope values return toward background values. Here we present a state-of-the-art age model for the PETM derived from a new orbital chronology developed with cycle stratigraphic records from sites drilled during ODP Leg 208 (Walvis Ridge, Southeastern Atlantic) integrated with published records from Site 690 (Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean, ODP Leg 113). During Leg 208, five Paleocene-Eocene (P-E) boundary sections (Sites 1262 to 1267) were recovered in multiple holes over a depth transect of more than 2200 m at the Walvis Ridge, yielding the first stratigraphically complete P-E deep-sea sequence with moderate to relatively high sedimentation rates (1 to 3 cm/ka, where “a” is years). A detailed chronology was developed with nondestructive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning records on the scale of precession cycles, with a total duration of the PETM now estimated to be ∼170 ka. The revised cycle stratigraphic record confirms original estimates for the duration of the onset and initial recovery but suggests a new duration for the final recovery that is intermediate to the previous estimates by cycle stratigraphy and HeET.},

	abstract = {The first complete cyclic sedimentary successions for the early Paleogene from drilling multiple holes have been retrieved during two ODP expeditions: Leg 198 (Shatsky Rise, NW Pacific Ocean) and Leg 208 (Walvis Ridge, SE Atlantic Ocean). These new records allow us to construct a comprehensive astronomically calibrated stratigraphic framework with an unprecedented accuracy for both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans covering the entire Paleocene epoch based on the identification of the stable long-eccentricity cycle (405-kyr). High resolution X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanner and non-destructive core logging data from Sites 1209 through 1211 (Leg 198) and Sites 1262, 1267 (Leg 208) are the basis for such a robust chronostratigraphy. Former investigated marine (ODP Sites 1001 and 1051) and land-based (e.g., Zumaia) sections have been integrated as well. The high-fidelity chronology is the prerequisite for deciphering mechanisms in relation to prominent transient climatic events as well as completely new insights into Greenhouse climate variability in the early Paleogene. We demonstrate that the Paleocene epoch covers 24 long eccentricity cycles. We also show that no definite absolute age datums for the K/Pg boundary or the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) can be provided by now, because of still existing uncertainties in orbital solutions and radiometric dating. However, we provide two options for tuning of the Paleocene which are only offset by 405-kyr. Our orbitally calibrated integrated Leg 208 magnetostratigraphy is used to revise the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) for Chron C29 to C25. We established a high-resolution calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy for the South Atlantic which allows a much more detailed relative scaling of stages with biozones. The re-evaluation of the South Atlantic spreading rate model features higher frequent oscillations in spreading rates for magnetochron C28r, C27n, and C26n.},

Based on counting of those cycles, we constrain the exact timing of two volcanic ash layers in Site 550 which correlate to ashes +19 and −17 of the Fur Formation in Denmark. The ashes, relative to the onset of the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), are offset by 862kyr and 672kyr, respectively. When combined with published absolute ages for ash −17, the absolute age for the onset of the PETM is consistent with astronomically calibrated ages. Using the current absolute age of 28.02Ma for the Fish Canyon Tuff (FCT) standard for calibrating the absolute age of ash −17 is consistent with tuning option 2 in the astronomically calibrated Paleocene time scale of Westerhold et al.

Using the recently recalibrated absolute age of 28.201Ma for the FCT standard is consistent with tuning option 3 in the astronomically calibrated Paleocene time scale.

The section contains two formation-scale, sedimentary sequences, that both consist of a siliciclastic lower part and a calcareous upper part. Siliciclastic sedimentation took place in distal floodplain and fluvial environments, while limestones resulted from carbonate precipitation in calcic soil profiles and in ephemeral lacustrine water bodies. Spectral analysis of the L* colour time series points to the influence of the ∼405-kyr and 0.97-Myr eccentricity cycles, while the bases of the two calcareous intervals correlate to successive minima of the 2.4-Myr eccentricity cycle. The 405-kyr cycle lags maximum eccentricity, whereas the 0.97 and 2.4-Myr cycles lag minimum eccentricity, each by approximately a quarter of a cycle. No obliquity forcing is detected. The observed orbital configuration of 2.4-Myr minima at the base of limestone-dominated intervals is similar to a previously documented Late Miocene shift in the Teruel Basin of northeast Spain. Our results indicate that long-period eccentricity climate forcing may well be a significant player on long, tectonic time scales in continental basin fill.},

Except for the interval of {\textasciitilde}2.2–0.7ka, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) controlled summer precipitation forced the hydrological variations. The Etzatlán-Magdalena Basin remained wet and some sites in central Mexico were dry over a large part of {\textasciitilde}2.2–0.7ka. The activity of tropical cyclones and frontal systems may have increased in the northeastern Pacific during this interval of enhanced ENSO.

	abstract = {In calcareous parent material, pedogenic carbonate formation mostly involves dissolution and recrystallization of lithogenic carbonates with CO2 of soil air, leading to a complete exchange of lithogenic carbon with soil-derived carbon. Interest in pedogenic carbonates has increased in recent decades because they are a useful tool for reconstructing paleoclimatic conditions (δ13C and δ18O) and past atmospheric CO2 concentrations as well as for radiocarbon dating of soils. For such investigations, the recrystallization rate of primary CaCO3 by pedogenic carbonate formation and the dependence of the recrystallization rate on environmental factors are essential, but still unquantified factors. The recrystallization rate of primary CaCO3 of loess at three CO2 concentrations was estimated by isotopic exchange between primary CaCO3 and the 14C of artificially labeled CO2. Loess was used for the study as a parent substrate for soil formation to simulate initial rates of CaCO3 recrystallization. CO2 concentrations of 380ppm, 5000ppm and 50,000ppm lead to recrystallization rates of 4.1·10−7day−1, 8.1·10−7day−1 and 16.9·10−7day−1, respectively. The relation between CO2 concentrations and recrystallization rates was described by a saturation curve. Under the tested experimental conditions, complete (95\%) recrystallization of loess carbonate and formation of pedogenic carbonate would take 4.9–20.0·103years, strongly depending on CO2 concentration. We expect faster recrystallization rates under field conditions because of permanent CO2 supply by root and rhizomicrobial respiration. This impedes the equilibrium between the inorganic C pools in solid, liquid and gaseous phases.},

	abstract = {Negative stable carbon isotope excursions (CIEs) across the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM; ∼56 Ma) range between 2‰ and 7‰, even after discounting sections with truncated records. Individual carbon isotope records differ in shape and magnitude from variations in the global exogenic carbon cycle through changes in (1) the relative abundance of mixed components with different δ13C within a measured substrate, (2) isotope fractionation through physiological change, and (3) the isotope composition of the carbon source. All three factors likely influence many early Paleogene δ13C records, especially across the PETM and other hyperthermal events. We apply these concepts to late Paleocene–early Eocene (∼58–52 Ma) records from Lomonosov Ridge, Arctic Ocean. Linear regression analyses show correlations between the δ13C of total organic carbon (TOC) and two proxies for the relative contribution of terrestrial organic components to sediment TOC: the branched and isoprenoid tetraether index and palynomorphs. We use these correlations to subtract the terrestrial component from δ13CTOC and calculate marine organic matter δ13C. The results show that the magnitude of the CIE in δ13CTOC across the PETM is exaggerated relative to the magnitude of the CIE in δ13CMOM by ∼3‰ due to increased contributions of terrestrial organic carbon during the event. Collectively, all carbon isotope records across the PETM and other major climate–carbon cycle perturbations in Earth's history are potentially biased through one or more of the above factors. Indeed, it is highly unlikely that any δ13C record shows the true shape and magnitude of the CIE for the global exogenic carbon cycle. For the PETM, we conclude that CIE in the exogenic carbon cycle is likely {\textless}4‰, but it will take additional analyses and modeling to obtain an accurate value for this CIE.},

	abstract = {The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, approx. 56 Ma) provides a test case for investigating how the Earth system responds to rapid greenhouse gas-driven warming. However, current rates of carbon emissions are approximately 10 Pg C yr−1, whereas those proposed for the PETM span orders of magnitude—from ≪1 Pg C yr−1 to greater than the anthropogenic rate. Emissions rate estimates for the PETM are hampered by uncertainty over the total mass of PETM carbon released as well as the PETM onset duration. Here, I review constraints on the onset duration of the carbon isotope excursion (CIE) that is characteristic of the event with a focus on carbon cycle model-based attempts that forgo the need for a traditional sedimentary age model. I also review and compare existing PETM carbon input scenarios employing the Earth system model cGENIE and suggest another possibility—that abrupt input of an isotopically depleted carbon source combined with elevated volcanic outgassing over a longer interval can together account for key features of the PETM CIE.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Hyperthermals: rapid and extreme global warming in our geological past’.},

	abstract = {The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) was caused by a massive release of carbon to the atmosphere. This is a benchmark global greenhouse warming event that raised temperatures to their warmest since extinction of the dinosaurs. Rates of carbon emission today can be compared to those during onset of the PETM in two ways: (1) projection of long-term PETM rates for comparison on an annual time scale and (2) projection of short-term modern rates for comparison on a PETM time scale. Both require temporal scaling and extrapolation for comparison on the same time scale. PETM rates are few and projection to a short time scale is poorly constrained. Modern rates are many, and projection to a longer PETM time scale is tightly constrained—modern rates are some 9–10 times higher than those during onset of the PETM. If the present trend of anthropogenic emissions continues, we can expect to reach a PETM-scale accumulation of atmospheric carbon in as few as 140 to 259 years (about 5 to 10 human generations).},

	abstract = {This study provides a comprehensive and quantitative estimate of how global temperatures have changed during the last 540 million years. It combines paleotemperature measurements determined from oxygen isotopes with broader insights obtained from the changing distribution of lithologic indicators of climate, such as coals, evaporites, calcretes, reefs, and bauxite deposits. The waxing and waning of the Earth’s great polar icecaps have been mapped using the past distribution of tillites, dropstones, and glendonites. The global temperature model presented here includes estimates of global average temperate (GAT), changing tropical temperatures (∆T° tropical), deep ocean temperatures, and polar temperatures. Though similar, in many respects, to the temperature history deduced directly from the study of oxygen isotopes, our model does not predict the extreme high temperatures for the Early Paleozoic required by isotopic investigations. The history of global changes in temperature during the Phanerozoic has been summarized in a “paleotemperature timescale” that subdivides the many past climatic events into 8 major climate modes; each climate mode is made up of 3-4 pairs of warming and cooling episodes (chronotemps). A detailed narrative describes how these past temperature events have been affected by geological processes such as the eruption of Large Igneous Provinces (LIPS) (warming) and bolide impacts (cooling). The paleotemperature model presented here allows for a deeper understanding of the interconnected geologic, tectonic, paleoclimatic, paleoceanographic, and evolutionary events that have shaped our planet, and we make explicit predictions about the Earth’s past temperature that can be tested and evaluated. By quantitatively describing the pattern of paleotemperature change through time, we may be able to gain important insights into the history of the Earth System and the fundamental causes of climate change on geological timescales. These insights can help us better understand the problems and challenges that we face as a result of Future Global Warming.},

	abstract = {Erosional surfaces set the architecture of fluvio-deltaic stratigraphy, and they have classically been interpreted in terms of changes in boundary conditions such as climate, tectonics, and base level (allogenic forces). Intrinsic dynamics of sedimentary systems (autogenic dynamics) can also create a rich stratigraphic architecture, and a major knowledge gap exists in parsing the relative roles of autogenic versus allogenic processes. Emerging theoretical and experimental work suggests that backwater hydrodynamics play an important role in driving transient channel incision in river deltas, even those experiencing net aggradation. Here, we identify and quantify two autogenic mechanisms that produce broad erosional surfaces in fluvio-deltaic stratigraphy, namely, floods and avulsions. Using a simple mass-balance model for single-threaded delta channel systems, we show that flood-induced scours begin near the shoreline, and avulsion-induced scours begin at the avulsion site, and both propagate upstream over a distance that scales with the backwater length, bed slope, and bed grain size. We also develop scaling relationships for the maximum scour depths arising from these mechanisms, which are functions of characteristic flow depth and formative flood variability. We test our theoretical predictions using a flume experiment of river delta evolution governed by persistent backwater hydrodynamics under constant relative sea level. Results indicate that autogenic dynamics of backwater-mediated deltas under conditions of constant base level can result in stratigraphic surfaces and shoreline trajectories similar to those often interpreted to represent multiple sea-level cycles. Our work provides a quantitative framework to decouple autogenic and allogenic controls on erosional surfaces preserved in fluvio-deltaic stratigraphy.},

	abstract = {Sequence stratigraphy relies on the identification of unconformity-bound sedimentary packages in order to understand variations in sediment supply, subsidence, and eustasy, which are themselves controlled by external (allogenic) drivers such as climate and tectonics. However, intrinsic (autogenic) river dynamics can also create a rich stratigraphic architecture in the absence of allogenic changes. Here, we outline scaling relationships for the expected depth and length scales of autogenic scour resulting from non-uniform flows in coastal rivers, and apply these relationships to the Upper Cretaceous Castlegate Sandstone—a classic fluvial sandstone unit in the Book Cliffs of Utah (USA). Theoretical and experimental work suggests that hydrodynamics within the backwater reach of coastal rivers—the zone of non-uniform flow that extends upstream of the river mouth—causes spatially extensive erosion during floods; this in turn creates erosional surfaces within fluvio-deltaic stratigraphy that may appear similar to sequence boundaries. Results demonstrate that scour patterns within the Castlegate Sandstone are consistent with the predictions of backwater-induced scours, and show how allogenic versus autogenic erosional surfaces can be parsed within fluvio-deltaic stratigraphy.},

	abstract = {Precipitation extremes have increased across many regions of the United States, with further increases anticipated in response to additional global warming. Quantifying the impact of these precipitation changes on flood damages is necessary to estimate the costs of climate change. However, there is little empirical evidence linking changes in precipitation to the historically observed increase in flood losses. We use {\textgreater}6,600 reports of state-level flood damage to quantify the historical relationship between precipitation and flood damages in the United States. Our results show a significant, positive effect of both monthly and 5-d state-level precipitation on state-level flood damages. In addition, we find that historical precipitation changes have contributed approximately one-third of cumulative flood damages over 1988 to 2017 (primary estimate 36\%; 95\% CI 20 to 46\%), with the cumulative impact of precipitation change totaling \$73 billion (95\% CI 39 to \$91 billion). Further, climate models show that anthropogenic climate forcing has increased the probability of exceeding precipitation thresholds at the extremely wet quantiles that are responsible for most flood damages. Climate models project continued intensification of wet conditions over the next three decades, although a trajectory consistent with UN Paris Agreement goals significantly curbs that intensification. Taken together, our results quantify the contribution of precipitation trends to recent increases in flood damages, advance estimates of the costs associated with historical greenhouse gas emissions, and provide further evidence that lower levels of future warming are very likely to reduce financial losses relative to the current global warming trajectory.},

The negative correlation between S and temperature weakens linearly with elevation, whereas the correlation between S and precipitation increases asymptotically with elevation. The curvilinear relationship in the latter case was not visible in prior studies because of the observation networks' limited range. In our historical validation, there is a range of threshold elevations (1580–2181 m) across six mountainous regions, above which precipitation is the main driver of snowpack variability and below which temperature is the main driver. Under a moderate end-of-century climate change scenario, these thresholds increase by 191 to 432 m. These rising thresholds indicate increasing spatial and elevational vulnerability of western U.S. spring snowpack along with associated impacts to hydrologic and ecologic systems.},

For the southernmost range (the White Mountains), spring snow at most elevations will disappear by the end of the twenty-first century. We investigate soil and fuel moisture changes for the five mountain ranges and for six lowland regions. The accelerated depletion of mountain snowpack due to warming leads to reduced summer soil moisture across mountain environments. Similarly, warmer and drier summers lead to decreases of up to 25\% in dead fuel moisture across all mountain ranges. Collective declines in spring mountain snowpack, summer soil moisture, and fuel moisture across western mountain ranges will increase fire potential in flammability-limited forested systems where fuels are not limiting. Projected changes in fire potential in predominately fuel-limited systems at lower elevations are more uncertain given the confounding signals between projected changes in soil moisture and fuel moisture.},

As a consequence, in a warmer climate forced by increasing CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ the intensity of the hydrological cycle can be either more or less intense depending upon the degree of surface warming.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

The characteristics examined include the mean spatial patterns, intraseasonal-to-interannual and ENSO-related variability, convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio, precipitation frequency and intensity for different precipitation categories, and diurnal cycle. Although most models reproduce the observed broad patterns of precipitation amount and year-to-year variability, models without flux corrections still show an unrealistic double-ITCZ pattern over the tropical Pacific, whereas the flux-corrected models, especially the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM; version 2.3.2a), produce realistic rainfall patterns at low latitudes. As in previous generations of coupled models, the rainfall double ITCZs are related to westward expansion of the cold tongue of sea surface temperature (SST) that is observed only over the equatorial eastern Pacific but extends to the central Pacific in the models. The partitioning of the total variance of precipitation among intraseasonal, seasonal, and longer time scales is generally reproduced by the models, except over the western Pacific where the models fail to capture the large intraseasonal variations. Most models produce too much convective (over 95\% of total precipitation) and too little stratiform precipitation over most of the low latitudes, in contrast to 45\%–65\% in convective form in the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite observations. The biases in the convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio are linked to the unrealistically strong coupling of tropical convection to local SST, which results in a positive correlation between the standard deviation of Niño-3.4 SST and the local convective-to-total precipitation ratio among the models. The models reproduce the percentage of the contribution (to total precipitation) and frequency for moderate precipitation (10–20 mm day$^{\textrm{−1}}$), but underestimate the contribution and frequency for heavy (\&gt;20 mm day$^{\textrm{−1}}$) and overestimate them for light (\&lt;10 mm day$^{\textrm{−1}}$) precipitation. The newest generation of coupled models still rains too frequently, mostly within the 1–10 mm day$^{\textrm{−1}}$ category. Precipitation intensity over the storm tracks around the eastern coasts of Asia and North America is comparable to that in the ITCZ (10–12 mm day$^{\textrm{−1}}$) in the TRMM data, but it is much weaker in the models. The diurnal analysis suggests that warm-season convection still starts too early in these new models and occurs too frequently at reduced intensity in some of the models. The results show that considerable improvements in precipitation simulations are still desirable for the latest generation of the world’s coupled climate models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

To compensate for the warm tropospheric temperature, atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) moisture must increase to maintain positive convective available potential energy (CAPE) in convective regions. In nonconvective regions, ABL moisture is controlled by different balances and does not increase as much, creating a spatial gradient of ABL moisture anomalies. Associated with this spatial pattern of the ABL moisture anomalies are two main mechanisms responsible for the anomalous tropical precipitation. In the “upped-ante mechanism,” increases in ABL moisture are opposed by imported dry air wherever inflow from nonconvective regions over margins of convective regions occurs. The ABL moisture is not enough to meet the higher “convective ante” induced by the warmer tropospheric temperature, so precipitation is decreased. In the “anomalous gross moist stability mechanism,” gross moist stability is reduced due to increased ABL moisture. As a result, convection is enhanced and precipitation becomes heavier over convective regions. While the upped-ante mechanism induces negative precipitation anomalies over the margins of convective regions, the anomalous gross moist stability mechanism induces positive precipitation anomalies within convective regions. The importance of variation in gross moist stability, which is likely to differ among climate models, is suggested as a potential factor causing discrepancies in the predicted regional tropical precipitation changes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

The role of supercell thunderstorms as flood agents is examined through analyses of storm systems that occurred in Texas (5–6 May 1995), Florida (26 March 1992), Nebraska (20–21 June 1996), and Pennsylvania (18–19 July 1996). Particular attention is given to the “Dallas Supercell,” which resulted in 16 deaths from flash flooding and more than \$1 billion in property damage during the evening of 5 May 1995. Rainfall analyses using Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) reflectivity observations and special mesonet rain gauge observations from Dallas, Texas, show that catastrophic flash flooding resulted from exceptional rainfall rates at 5–60-min timescales. The spatial structure of extreme rainfall was linked to supercell structure and motion. The “Orlando Supercell” produced extreme rainfall rates (greater than 300 mm h$^{\textrm{−1}}$) at 1–5-min timescales over a dense rain gauge network. The Nebraska and Pennsylvania storm systems produced record flooding over larger spatial scales than the Texas and Florida storms, by virtue of organization and motion of multiple storms over the same region. For both the Nebraska and Pennsylvania storms, extreme rainfall and tornadoes occurred in tandem. Severe rainfall measurement problems arise for supercell thunderstorms, both from conventional gauge networks and weather radar. It is hypothesized that supercell storms play a significant role in the “climatology” of extreme rainfall rates (100-yr return interval and greater) at short time intervals (1–60 min) in much of the central and eastern United States.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Squamish River basin occupies 3600 km2 of mountainous terrain in south-western British Columbia, about 50 km north of Vancouver. The magnitude, volume and duration of extreme floods (Q ≥ 1500 m3/s) exhibit respective temporal increases of 50, 450 and 300\%. The increase in extreme floods is attributed to the intensification of late-season (August–December) Pacific storms that have produced increases in precipitation amounts, intensity and duration of respectively 340, 200 and 200\% over the same period. Changes in floodplain-surface area calculated from the geographic information system (GIS) differencing of sequential large-scale aerial photographs indicate that the rate of geomorphic change in Squamish River has accelerated during the 1980s to the mid-1990s. Among four study reaches of varying planform, erosional, depositional and cumulative changes in floodplain surface-area have rapidly increased. Channel-change activity after 1980 has increased by a factor of two to six compared with the period prior to 1980. Erosion is currently outpacing deposition in the majority of study reaches. Although channel geometry generally exhibits no uniform pattern of response to the increase in extreme floods, the meandering reaches have straightened over the duration of the study period. The increase in the magnitude and duration of the annual flood appears to be the principal cause of this recent acceleration of channel change. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {China is an agricultural country with the largest population in the world. However, intensification of droughts and floods and amplification of precipitation extremes are having critical negative impacts on agriculture. In this study, flood- and drought-affected, flood- and drought-damaged crop areas, and also flood- and drought-induced agricultural loss from 29 provinces across China are analyzed in both space and time. Results indicate the following: (1) Large parts of China are dominated by intensified floods. Comparatively, spatial ranges dominated by intensifying drought hazards are smaller than those by intensifying flood hazards. (2) Drought intensity is increasing in northwest China with moderate changes in the degree of influence. Increasing flood intensity can be observed in northwest, southwest and central China. However, flood risks are higher in arid regions such as northwest China and drought risks are higher in humid regions such as southwest China. (3) Agreements are identified between abrupt behaviors of flood-affected and -destroyed crop areas. The change points of flood-affected and -destroyed crop areas is in the 1980s in northeast, north and central China and in the 1990s in south and southwest China. Nevertheless, spatial patterns of the change points in the drought-affected and -destroyed crop areas are sporadic but not confirmative. (4) Flood- and drought-induced losses of agricultural production have significant increasing trends in most parts of China. The loss rate and loss magnitude of agriculture before change points are significantly higher than those after change points. (5) Generally, amplifications of precipitation extremes, decreasing consecutive wet days and increasing consecutive dry days in both space and time are the major driving factors behind the changes of drought- and flood-affected, and -destroyed crop areas and their impacts on agriculture across China. These results are theoretically and practically relevant for planning and management of agricultural activities and may help provide a theoretical framework for similar studies in other regions of the globe.},

It further limits what can be said about future impacts of floods on society based on predicted changes in the global hydrological cycle. This paper presents a conceptual framework for the systematic assessment of the factors that condition observed trends in flood damage. Using the framework, it assesses the role that variability in precipitation has in damaging flooding in the United States at national and regional levels. Three different measures of flood damage—absolute, per capita, and per unit wealth—each lead to different conclusions about the nature of the flood problem. At a national level, of the 10 precipitation measures examined in this study, the ones most closely related to flood damage are the number of 2-day heavy rainfall events and the number of wet days. Heavy rainfall events are defined relative to a measure of average rainfall in each area, not as absolute thresholds. The study indicates that the growth in recent decades in total damage is related to both climate factors and societal factors: increased damage is associated with increased precipitation and with increasing population and wealth. At the regional level, this study reports a stronger relationship between precipitation measures and flood damage, and indicates that different measures of precipitation are most closely related to damage in different regions. This study suggests that climate plays an important, but by no means determining, role in the growth in damaging floods in the United States in recent decades.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

High unit discharges (peak discharge per unit contributing area) from basins with areas of 2.6 to 26,000 km2 (1–10,000 mi2) are widespread, but streams in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Texas together account for more than 50\% of the highest unit discharges. The Appalachians and western flanks of Pacific coastal mountain systems are also regions of high unit discharges, as are several areas in the southern Midwest. By contrast, few exceptional discharges have been recorded in the interior West, northern Midwest, and Atlantic Coastal Plain. Most areas of high unit discharges result from the combination of (1) regional atmospheric conditions that produce large precipitation volumes and (2) steep topography, which enhances precipitation by convective and orographic processes and allows flow to be quickly concentrated into stream channels. Within the conterminous United States, the greatest concentration of exceptional unit discharges is at the Balcones Escarpment of central Texas, where maximum U.S. rainfall amounts apparently coincide with appropriate basin physiography to produce many of the largest measured U.S. floods. Flood-related fatalities broadly correspond to the spatial distribution of high unit discharges, with Texas having nearly twice the average annual flood-related fatalities of any other state.},

	abstract = {River deltas worldwide are currently under threat of drowning and destruction by sea-level rise, subsidence, and oceanic storms, highlighting the need to quantify their growth processes. Deltas are built through construction of sediment lobes, and emerging theories suggest that the size of delta lobes scales with backwater hydrodynamics, but these ideas are difficult to test on natural deltas that evolve slowly. We show results of the first laboratory delta built through successive deposition of lobes that maintain a constant size. We show that the characteristic size of delta lobes emerges because of a preferential avulsion node—the location where the river course periodically and abruptly shifts—that remains fixed spatially relative to the prograding shoreline. The preferential avulsion node in our experiments is a consequence of multiple river floods and Froude-subcritical flows that produce persistent nonuniform flows and a peak in net channel deposition within the backwater zone of the coastal river. In contrast, experimental deltas without multiple floods produce flows with uniform velocities and delta lobes that lack a characteristic size. Results have broad applications to sustainable management of deltas and for decoding their stratigraphic record on Earth and Mars.
Experimental delta lobe size is controlled by bed adjustment to transient floods within the backwater zone.

	abstract = {In this paper we seek to understand the nature of flood spatial dependence over the conterminous United States. We extend an existing conditional multivariate statistical model to enable its application to this large and heterogenous region and apply it to a 40-year data set of 2,400 U.S. Geological Survey gauge series records to simulate 1,000 years of U.S. flooding comprising more than 63,000 individual events with realistic spatial dependence. A continental-scale hydrodynamic model at 30 m resolution is then used to calculate the economic loss arising from each of these events. From this we are able to compute the probability that different values of U.S. annual total economic loss due to flooding are exceeded (i.e., a loss-exceedance curve). Comparing these data to an observed flood loss-exceedance curve for the period 1988–2017 shows a reasonable match for annual losses with probability below 10\% (e.g., {\textgreater}1 in 10-year return period). This analysis suggests that there is a 1\% chance of U.S. annual fluvial flood losses exceeding \$78Bn in any given year, and a 0.1\% chance of them exceeding \$136Bn. Analysis of the set of stochastic events and losses yields new insights into the nature of flooding and flood risk in the United States. In particular, we confirm the strong relationship between flood affected area and event peak magnitude, but show considerable variability in this relationship between adjacent U.S. regions. The analysis provides a significant advance over previous national flood risk analyses as it gives the full loss-exceedance curve instead of simply the average annual loss.},

	abstract = {AbstractUnderstanding future changes in the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme events in response to increased greenhouse gas forcing is important for formulating adaptation and mitigation strategies that minimize damages to natural and human systems. We quantify transient changes in daily-scale seasonal extreme precipitation events over the U.S. using a five-member ensemble of nested, high-resolution climate model simulations covering the 21st century in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario. We find a strong drying trend in annual and seasonal precipitation over the Southwest in autumn, winter, and spring and over the central U.S. in summer. These changes are accompanied by statistically significant increases in dry-day frequency and dry-spell lengths. Our results also show substantial increases in the frequency of extreme wet events over the northwestern U.S. in autumn, winter, and spring and the eastern U.S. in spring and summer. In addition, the average precipitation intensity increases relative to the extreme precipitation intensity in all seasons and most regions, with the exception of the Southeast. Further, most regions receive a greater fraction of total seasonal precipitation from extreme events. These results imply fewer but heavier precipitation events in the future, leading to more frequent wet and dry extremes in most regions of the U.S. Our simulations suggest that many of these changes are likely to become statistically significant by the mid-21st century. Given current vulnerabilities, such changes in extreme precipitation could be expected to increase stress on water resources in many areas of the U.S., including during the near-term decades.},

	abstract = {In this report the present methods to determine the dominant discharge will be discussed. A method to determine the dominant discharge by means of a transient flow computation will be given. Measurements that have been carried out to test the methods will be described. The dominant discharge has been established for the river Waal. Any change made in a river, changes in course, charge, discharge or channel geometry, even when only locally will eventually have its effects on the river as a whole. These effects will have to be predicted by river engineers. In order to make these predictions computations will have to be carried out and frequently use will be made of models, mathematical models or hydraulic models. In these models \&quot;things\&quot; happen very much faster than in nature, which enables one to predict. The carrying out of computations and the use of models requires that certain simplifications are made. The purpose of this study is to find out which adverse consequences may be expected when a certain method is adopted, which parameters, if any, are reproduced correctly, and accordingly if a certain parameter is selected which method to determine the dominant discharge is the most sui table. The original concept of dominant discharge has been developed by irrigation engineers in India and Pakistan as a further development of the regime theory. The original methods to compute the dominant discharge such as bankfull stage were largely based on intuition and had in fact mainly a statistical value, It has been tried to generalise the method by taking into account the amount of bedload carried; it was assumed that the dominant discharge was that discharge where the bulk of the bedload was carried. This would not be a peak discharge because, although the corresponding bedload would be large its duration would be too short, It would also not be a very low discharge because the longer duration would not make good the low amount of bedload carried per unit time. Methods to compute a dominant discharge as used up till now do not have much physical significance and cannot be used for prediction of bed-features under future conditions. It is possible to determine a dominant discharge by means of a transient flow computation provided the width of the channel and the characteristics of the bedmaterial are known. The dominant discharge found in that way has a much greater physical significance but is valid for one cross-section only. This discharge is connected to one parameter only, any other parameter results in a different dominant discharge. With this type of discharge it is possible, with the limitations mentioned, to predict features of the channelbed after conditions have changed.},

	abstract = {An analysis of old maps and documentary sources reveals that major changes in river channel planform have occurred over the last 200 years on the River Tay system, Scotland, UK. Reaches showing natural river channel planform change, however, are relatively small and a stable planform is characteristic of many sections of the river. River planform instability appears to be controlled by channel bed slope, sediment load and the enhanced vulnerability of former river channel courses to erosion. Flood protection embankments built in the 19th and 20th centuries modified unstable multichannel wandering gravel bed river sections to narrower single-channel reaches, with limited lateral migration. On the River Tummel, 20th century impoundment has caused further geomorphological change in response to clearwater erosion close to the dam and aggradation processes within the regulated river downstream, but isolation of the effects of impoundment from those of channelization are problematic. An examination of the geomorphic effects of a high magnitude flood event in 1990 and historical accounts of earlier large floods reveal that the 1990 flood was the third largest since 1800 in the study area. Despite river regulation and bank protection the zones naturally characterized by instability are still susceptible to planform changes causing flood embankments to be breached, channel shifts and development of gravel bars.},

	abstract = {Here we describe results from an alluvial delta physical experiment with and without steady base-level rise. Using a unique cohesive sediment mixture that promotes the development of persistent channels and a rugose shoreline, we quantitatively characterize channel network properties as a function of base-level rise in a distributary system that reproduces many aspects of the geometry of natural deltas. Analysis of the experimental data shows clear dynamical differences between the predominantly progadational and aggradational phases of the experiment. The experiment was conducted in two phases: a first in which the delta prograded into standing water of constant depth in the absence of base-level rise and a second during which steady base-level rise was imposed on the system, forcing a twofold increase in topset aggradation due to greater sediment retention in the fluvial reach. The shift in sediment mass balance to enhanced fluvial deposition in the second phase caused channel network mobility to increase, reducing the autogenic channel time scale from 23.5 to 12.5 h and supporting a positive correlation between deposition and channel avulsion frequency. An independent shoreline time scale that characterizes the dominant time over which shoreline regression is persistent closely correlates with measurements of the channel network (28.3 h during fan progradation and 9.5 h during fan aggradation). These metrics suggest a strong coupling between channel network and shoreline kinematics and a more active fluvial surface during fan aggradation by a factor of 2 to 3, similar to the increase in aggradation rate. Spatial scaling of shoreline roughness reveals that maximum shoreline variability is set by the scale of distributary lobes. Strong coupling exists between delta growth and shoreline geometry during progradation. During aggradation, however, shoreline variability is not solely due to distributary lobe growth but is also set by shoreline transgression over inactive portions of the delta, illustrating a decoupling between fan kinematics and fan geometry. This decoupling, together with the matched increase in channel network mobility and fluvial aggradation, suggest the stratigraphic architecture may not be a strong geometric signal of different fluvial surface conditions either.},

This paper puts forward the proposition that sedimentation systems generally are in stasis. Three lines of evidence suggest the proposition is largely correct: (1) considerations of how sedimentation systems necessarily operate, (2) observations of active systems, and (3) a re-evaluation of ideas about sedimentation rates. There are of course systems to which the proposition cannot apply. A simulation exercise is used to address questions about the stratigraphic effects of stasis. The results show (1) that sedimentation systems that generally are in stasis can be of a variety of types, (2) that stasis is readily preserved in stratigraphic successions, (3) that successions produced by a system in which the time proportion of stasis is high are markedly more complete than successions produced by other systems of the same type, (4) that the proportion of stasis in a system cannot be estimated reliably from stratigraphic successions produced by that system, and (5) that the stratigraphic succession finally left behind by a system is necessarily a systematically biased and partial record of the history of that system. What is always missing is that part of the history before the oldest preserved horizon, which for systems that are in long-term balance will on average be half of the total time.},

We focus on the distribution of the upper tail ratio, which is defined as the peak discharge for the flood of record at a stream gaging station divided by the sample 10-year flood magnitude. The 14 June 1903 Heppner storm, which produced an upper tail ratio of 200, was the product of a hailstorm that formed along the Blue Mountains in eastern Oregon, a region dominated by snowmelt flooding. A striking contrast between record flood peaks and the larger distribution of annual flood peaks in the United States is in the seasonality of flood occurrence, with record floods reflecting a much stronger contribution from warm season thunderstorm systems. Mountainous terrain and intense convective rainfall are important elements of the geography and hydrometeorology of extreme upper tail ratio flood peaks. The distribution of upper tail ratio values for USGS stream gaging stations does not depend on basin area, a result which is consistent with scaling results based on extreme value theory. Downscaling simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting model are used to examine the storm environment of the 1903 Heppner storm, along with two other record flood peaks near the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon from the USGS miscellaneous flood record, the July 1956 Meyers Canyon flood and the July 1965 Lane Canyon flood.},

The tendency towards establishing a dynamic equilibrium is inherent in all natural systems that contain negative feedbacks between processes capable of compensating each other. In geomorpbology, equilibrium tendencies of the mass budget are more relevant than those of the energy budget. The validity of the equilibrium concept is discussed at several scales from a slope point to entire slopes, drainage basins and mountain ranges. The effects of eksystemic changes vary depending upon the length of the intervals between such changes in comparison to the length of the required relaxation times.

	abstract = {The normalized difference water index (NDWI) of McFeeters (1996) was modified by substitution of a middle infrared band such as Landsat TM band 5 for the near infrared band used in the NDWI. The modified NDWI (MNDWI) can enhance open water features while efficiently suppressing and even removing built‐up land noise as well as vegetation and soil noise. The enhanced water information using the NDWI is often mixed with built‐up land noise and the area of extracted water is thus overestimated. Accordingly, the MNDWI is more suitable for enhancing and extracting water information for a water region with a background dominated by built‐up land areas because of its advantage in reducing and even removing built‐up land noise over the NDWI.},

	abstract = {Alluvial stratigraphic records are notoriously incomplete. All stratigraphic sections within sedimentary basins experience varying episodes of erosion and geomorphic stasis during their accumulation. This has detrimental effects on the completeness of paleoclimatic and paleobiologic records. Here we evaluate the resultant stratigraphic incompleteness using a physical experiment with self-organized vertical scales of topography and lateral scales of geomorphic stasis. First, we document how stratigraphic completeness improves as the temporal discretization interval coarsens, and show that the primary cause of the missing time shifts from stasis to erosion as the discretization is coarsened. Second, we demonstrate that the debilitating effect of finer temporal resolution can be predictably offset by compositing records across a wider area, and present a new two-dimensional formulation of stratigraphic completeness. These findings imply systematic shifts in taphonomic preservation, and by extension, the quality of paleobiologic and paleoclimatic proxy records.},

The objective of the model application, which is presented in the companion paper (Wright and Parker, 2005), is to study the development of two characteristics of large, low-slope, sand-bed rivers: (1) a downstream decrease in bed slope (i.e. concave upward longitudinal profile) and (2) a downstream decrease in characteristic bed sediment diameter (e.g. the median bed surface size D 50). Three mechanisms that lead to an upward concave profile and downstream fining are included in the modeling formulation: (1) a delta prograding into standing water at the downstream boundary, (2) sea-level rise, and (3) tectonic subsidence. In the companion paper (Wright and Parker, 2005) the model is applied to simulate the development of the longitudinal profile and downstream fining in sand-bed rivers flowing into the ocean during the past 5000 years of relatively slow sea-level rise.},

A mechanistic formulation of flow and sediment transport through river channels is combined with a simple quantification of the overall effect of frequent avulsion to derive relations describing the temporal and spatial evolution of mean (i.e., averaged over many avulsions) bed slope and elevation in an axially symmetric fan. An example of a fan formed predominantly by the deposition of sand is compared to a similar one formed predominantly by the deposition of gravel. In each example the case of channelized flow is compared to the case of sheet flow. The model is applied to the tailings basin of a mine in the companion paper.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an overview of tropical river systems around the world and identifies major knowledge gaps. We focus particularly on the rivers draining the wet and wet–dry tropics with annual rainfall of more than 700 mm/year. The size of the analyzed river basins varies from 104 to 6×106 km2. The tropical rivers across the globe drain a variety of geologic–geomorphologic settings: (a) orogenic mountains belts, (b) sedimentary and basaltic plateau/platforms, (c) cratonic areas, (d) lowland plains in sedimentary basins and (e) mixed terrain. All of them show clearly high but variable peak discharges during the rainy season and a period of low flow when rainfall decreases. Some tropical rivers show two flood peaks, a principal and a secondary one, during the year. We computed the intensity of floods and discharge variability in tropical rivers. The relationship between sediment yield and average water discharge for orogenic continental rivers of South America and Asia was also plotted. Insular Asian rivers show lower values of sediment yield related to mean annual discharge than continental orogenic rivers of Asia and South America. Rivers draining platforms or cratonic areas in savanna and wet tropical climates are characterized by low sediment yields. Tropical rivers exhibit a large variety of channel form. In most cases, and particularly in large basins, rivers exhibit a transition from one form to another so that traditional definitions of straight, meandering and braided may be difficult to apply. In general, it is more useful to apply the terminology of single and multi-channel systems or complex anabranching systems at least for selected regional segments. Present-day knowledge of tropical systems and its potential application to improve interpretation of older alluvial sequences and facies models are briefly discussed. Human impact and river management issues including land use changes, mining, dams, interbasin water transference as well as flood hazards are some of the daunting problems in tropical river basins today.},

Here, we define a global monsoon rain domain according to annual precipitation range, using simple objective criteria; then, we propose metrics for quantifying the intensity of the global monsoon precipitation. The results suggest an overall weakening of the global land monsoon precipitation in the last 56 years, primarily due to weakening of the summer monsoon rainfall in the Northern Hemisphere. However, since 1980, the global land monsoon rainfall has seen no significant trend, which contrasts with the rapid intensification of global warming during the same period. Meanwhile the oceanic monsoon precipitation shows an increasing trend after 1980. The results provide a rigorous test for climate models that will be used in future climate-change assessment.},

	abstract = {Time-lapse airborne lidar on the coastal Trinity River in Texas, USA, shows profound downstream variability in point bar growth and cut bank erosion resulting from a historically large flood that occurred in 2015. The difference map generated from two surveys covers 55 river bends and captures the transition from quasi-uniform flow into backwater flow. In the upstream portion of the survey, reach-averaged deposition is greater than erosion, with high local variability between the two due to the occurrence of bend cutoffs. Point bars shift laterally up to 3 times as much as cut bank retreat in this area. In the backwater zone, cut bank erosion consistently outpaces deposition on point bars and cut bank retreat exceeds the lateral shift of the point bar. Edge-to-edge channel width, measured from active scroll bar to outer bank, increases for all bends. This widening is often partially due to point bar widening and movement of the scroll bar away from the channel. The combination of net erosion and limited lateral movement of point bars within the backwater zone implies that during large sustained floods, bank pull instigates channel migration in this area. Farther upstream, net deposition and the high ratio of point bar to cut bank lateral motion imply bar push is more important. Patterns of deposition and erosion within a single bend suggest that channel migration was dominated by downstream bend translation with little bend deformation. Results from this study help to deepen the understanding of coastal river system morphodynamics by connecting changes in the geomorphology to changes in river bend kinematics, hydraulics, and sediment transport.},

	abstract = {Active deposition across the floodplains of large rivers arises through a variety of processes; collectively these are here termed ‘spillage sedimentation’. Three groups of 11 spillage sedimentation styles are identified and their formative processes described. Form presences on large river floodplains show different combinations of active spillage styles. Only some large floodplains have prominent levees; some have coarse splays; many have accessory channel dispersion and reworking, while still-water sedimentation in lacustrine environments dominates some lower reaches. Infills are also commonly funnelled into prior, and often linear, negative relief forms relating to former migration within the mainstream channel belt. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Landsat 8 data are used to map spillage form types and coverage along a 1700 km reach of the Amazon that has an active floodplain width of up to 110 km with a systematic character transformation down-valley. Spillage forms associated directly with mainstream processes rarely account for more than 5\% of the floodplain deposits. There is a marked decrease in floodplain point bar complexes (PBC) over 1700 km downstream (from 34\% to 5\%), and an increase in the prevalence of large water bodies (2\% to 37\%) and accompanying internal crevasses and deltas (0\% to 5\%). Spillage sedimentation is likely within the negative relief associated with these forms, depending on mainstream sediment-laden floodwater inputs. Spillage style dominance depends on the balance between sediment loadings, hydrological sequencing, and morphological opportunity. Down-river form sequences are likely to follow gradient change, prior up-river sediment sequestration and the altered nature of spilled loads, but also crucially, local floodplain relief and incident water levels and velocities at spillage times. Considering style distribution quantitatively, as a spatially distributed set of identifiable forms, emphasizes the global variety to spillage phenomena along and between large rivers. © 2016 The Authors.
